# Working Notes — MACH-I Website Revision Sprint

## Project Status: COMPLETE — READY FOR CLIENT REVIEW

## Sprint Summary
9-phase revision sprint implementing all of Dr. D's feedback from "Web Site changes.docx". All phases executed, all acceptance criteria met, all verification checks passed.

### What Was Done
1. **Removed Dr. Young and all pulmonary content** across all pages (preserved in HTML comments for future)
2. **Updated home page** — credentials, messaging, NATO role fix, "thousands" not "hundreds"
3. **Rewrote about page bio** with full CV highlights, added headshot
4. **Major services page revamp** — executive cardio eval, free consultation banner, speaking engagements
5. **Added CVG/CMH airports** to special issuance FAQ and contact page
6. **Site-wide consistency pass** — NATO title, orphaned links, CSS cleanup
7. **Full UI/UX review** at desktop/tablet/mobile viewports
8. **Fixed P2 issues** (gold callout box), cleaned orphaned CSS
9. **Created dr-d-review.html** — integrated review page with change summary and 13-item checklist

### Commits (8 revision commits)
```

cda8713  Add Dr. D review page with change summary and checklist
8c6a6da  Fix UI issues found in post-revision review
```

### Final Review
`build-monitor/reports/final-review.md` — comprehensive review with checklist, grep verification, risk assessment, and sprint grade (A).

### Open Items for Future Work
- Verify Netlify auto-deploy succeeded and live site reflects all changes
- Test contact and intake form submissions on live site
- Contact page hours: using 8-5 default; revisit if Dr. D prefers evening/Saturday hours
- Logo photo (`feedback/We made LOGO on DOOR of OFFICE.PNG`) unused — may need for future branding
- Pulmonary services ready to re-enable when Dr. Young joins (HTML comments preserved)
- New email setup (separate project — Mac Studio sessions)
- Encrypted inbox for medical records (separate project)
- Testimonials system (future feature)

## Previous State (preserved)
The Mac Studio setup plan (Sessions 1-3) remains valid and is tracked in `setup/` directory. That work is independent of this revision sprint.

## Checkpoint — 2026-03-03 10:32:28

**Branch:** main
**Uncommitted changes:** M working-notes.md
**Session work:**
- Completed full Dr. D feedback revision sprint (9 phases + final review)
- Removed Dr. Young and all pulmonary content site-wide
- Updated home page credentials, messaging, NATO role
- Rewrote about page bio with CV highlights, added upscaled headshot
- Major services page revamp — Executive Cardiovascular Evaluation, free consultation banner, speaking engagements
- Added CVG/CMH airports to special issuance FAQ and contact page
- Site-wide consistency pass, UI/UX review, final fixes
- Created dr-d-review.html — interactive review page with 13-item checklist for Dr. D
- Processed and integrated MACH-I logo (heart+wings) — full-color banner above nav + white silhouette in footer
- All pushed to GitHub and deployed to https://mach-i-cardiology.netlify.app
- Elon final review: SHIP — Grade A
- Team retrospective completed, memory files updated

**Next step:** Send Dr. D the review page link (https://mach-i-cardiology.netlify.app/dr-d-review.html) for his sign-off on 13 items. Key ask: high-res headshot photo.
**Blockers:** Need Dr. D's review/sign-off. Need original high-res headshot. Netlify auto-deploy not wired up (using manual `netlify deploy --prod --dir=.`).
**Notes:** Contact hours kept as 8-5 Mon-Fri virtual availability (Dr. D's default preference). Logo on office door photo processed to transparent PNG. Pulmonary content preserved in HTML comments for future re-addition. Sprint retro lessons saved to agents/memory/shared.md and pepper.md.

## 2026-03-05 — Tech Stack Scoping for Dr. D's Practice

### What Was Done
- Reviewed existing HIPAA file sharing research (research/hipaa-file-sharing.md)
- Scoped complete tech stack for Dr. D's medical practice:
  - Google Workspace (already purchased) for email + calendar
  - OpenClaw (self-hosted, Docker) for CRM/automation with OpenAI OAuth
  - Patient Gain ($99/mo) for HIPAA-compliant medical records transfer
  - Claude Code for website self-service editing
  - GitHub for version control + remote safety net (auto-push via launchd)
  - Tailscale for remote support access
  - Netlify auto-deploy from GitHub
- Created comprehensive meeting runbook: research/dr-d-tech-stack-setup.md (861 lines, 12 phases, ~6 hour meeting)
- Created prep/ directory with:
  - CLAUDE.md guardrails for Dr. D's website project
  - launchd auto-push plist + shell script + installer
  - .gitignore files for website and OpenClaw repos
  - Installer download checklist with URLs
  - Draft email to Dr. D requesting pre-meeting info

### Key Decisions
- Google Workspace instead of Fastmail (Dr. D already purchased it)
- OpenAI OAuth for OpenClaw (not Anthropic)
- Keep HIPAA compliance confined to Patient Gain file transfers — no PHI in email/calendar
- Everything pushes to GitHub automatically so Scott can help remotely
- Tailscale node sharing (free) for remote access — separate accounts, shared device

### Monthly Cost for Dr. D
- Patient Gain: $99
- Anthropic (Claude Code): ~$20
- OpenAI (OpenClaw): ~$20
- Google Workspace: already purchased
- Tailscale, GitHub, Netlify: free
- **Total: ~$139/mo**

### Next Steps
- [ ] Send email to Dr. D requesting pre-meeting info
- [ ] Get domain registrar access and do DNS changes 24-48h before meeting
- [ ] Pre-build OpenClaw skills on Scott's instance (lead intake, appointment manager, patient contacts, secure upload trigger, recall/follow-up, daily briefing)
- [ ] Download all installers to USB drive
- [ ] Pre-pull OpenClaw Docker image
- [ ] Schedule the 6-hour meeting
- [ ] Get Dr. D's high-res headshot

### Open Questions (Need Dr. D's Input)
- Email address format preference
- Domain registrar login
- GitHub account (existing or create new?)
- Mac Studio specs and current state
- Preferred notification channel (email only? Telegram? SMS?)
- Calendar — anything to migrate?

## Checkpoint — 2026-03-05 14:09:16

**Branch:** main
**Uncommitted changes:** None (all pushed to GitHub)
**Session work:**
- Scoped complete tech stack for Dr. D's medical practice (Google Workspace, OpenClaw, Patient Gain, Claude Code, GitHub, Tailscale, Netlify)
- Created comprehensive FaceTime meeting runbook (research/dr-d-tech-stack-setup.md) — 4-step structure: Tailscale → Scott SSHs + installs → accounts → training (~2 hours)
- Built complete OpenClaw "Mach 1 Front Desk" agent (prep/openclaw/) — 25 files: workspace, templates, hooks, cron jobs, config
- Created all prep materials (prep/) — CLAUDE.md guardrails, auto-push launchd, .gitignore files, installer download script, email draft to Eddie
- Confirmed mach1cardiology.com registered by Dr. D today (Squarespace, Google DNS)
- Verified Tailscale running on Scott's machine (100.65.205.84)
- Saved end-of-session git commit rule to project memory

**Next step:** Send email to Eddie (prep/email-to-dr-d-meeting-prep.md — HTML preview at prep/email-preview.html). Once he replies with Squarespace login, do DNS changes 24-48h before the FaceTime call.

**Blockers:**
- Need Eddie's Squarespace domain registrar login (for DNS/MX changes)
- Need Eddie to confirm mach1cardiology.com as primary domain + email
- Need Eddie to confirm redirect of medicalaerospacecardiology.com to new site
- Need to schedule the FaceTime call (~2 hours)

**Pre-call prep still TODO:**
- Run download-installers.sh to pre-download Docker/Tailscale/Node.js
- Pre-pull OpenClaw Docker image (docker save)
- DNS changes once registrar access obtained
- Test OpenClaw agent on Scott's instance before deploying to Eddie's

**Notes:** Meeting is via FaceTime, not in-person. Eddie installs Tailscale, Scott SSHs in and does everything else. OpenClaw uses OpenAI (gpt-4o), not Anthropic. Gmail bridge hook and Netlify webhook hook are skeleton/TODO — need testing. No PHI in email/calendar — Patient Gain handles HIPAA file transfers.
