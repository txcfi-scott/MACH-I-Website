- [ ] **YouTube timing** — Site must be fully ready before Pat Brown / Mad Props Aero interview

## Domain Name Candidates

| # | Domain | Why |
|---|--------|-----|
| 1 | flymach.com | Short, punchy, aviation + brand in 7 chars |
| 2 | mach1cardio.com | Brand name + specialty. Clear and professional |
| 3 | mach1med.com | Even shorter. MACH-1 + medicine |
| 4 | machimed.com | 8 chars. "MACH-I" + "med" reads naturally |
| 5 | flyingheartdoc.com | Memorable, tells the whole story |
| 6 | mach1cardiology.com | Full spelling, still way shorter than current |
| 7 | clearedtofly.com | ATC phraseology every pilot knows |
| 8 | flyagain.com | Speaks to the patient's goal. Could be a tagline |
| 9 | pilotcardio.com | SEO-friendly, clear about audience + specialty |
| 10 | mach1heart.com | Brand + heart. Warm and approachable |

aviationcardiology.com is taken but expires Aug 2026 — worth watching. All .com domains above ~$10-15/year.
