### Status Summary Form
- Available at: https://www.faa.gov/ame_guide/media/Pacemaker_Status_Summary.pdf

---

## 9. Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (ICD)

### FAA Disposition -- HISTORICAL POLICY
- **All Classes:** DENY -- ICDs have been considered permanently disqualifying
- **AASI Eligible:** No
- **CACI Eligible:** No
- The FAA historically required ICD deactivation or removal as a condition of any medical certification
- Listed under "Anti-tachycardia Devices" and "Implantable Defibrillators" as requiring deferral in the AME Guide

### Historic Policy Change (2025)
- **In April 2025, the FAA issued its FIRST-EVER medical certificate to a pilot with an active ICD**
- The pilot was a Delta Air Lines captain who had suffered cardiac arrest inflight (May 2020)
- Diagnosis: PVC-triggered ventricular fibrillation, successfully ablated at Mayo Clinic
- The ICD had been implanted for 4.5+ years and had NEVER fired or delivered a shock
- A Special Issuance medical certificate was granted (effectively first-class privileges)
- Legal representation demonstrated the pilot's incapacitation risk equaled or was lower than standard first-class certificate holders

### Current Status
- This appears to be a one-off precedent, not a systematic policy change
- The standard AME Guide disposition for ICDs remains DENY/DEFER
- Any future ICD cases would likely require individual petition to AMCD with extensive documentation
- **UNCERTAINTY NOTE:** It is unclear whether the FAA has formalized any new protocol for active ICDs or if this remains a case-by-case precedent. The AME Guide as of the most recent update still lists ICDs as disqualifying.

- **Special Issuance:** Available for most cases after treatment
- **CACI Eligible:** No

### Size Limits for Untreated Aneurysms
- The FAA will **generally not consider** any case in which an untreated aneurysm exceeds **4.5 cm** in size
- Aneurysms <5 cm without symptoms may qualify with conservative management

### Conservative Management (Small, Asymptomatic Aneurysms)
- Smoking cessation
- Blood pressure control
- LDL cholesterol reduction
- Beta blockers to slow expansion rate
- Ultrasound or CT monitoring every 6-12 months

### Post-Surgical Repair Requirements

#### Required Documentation
- Hospital records: all diagnostic tests, admission H&P, operative report, discharge summary
- Cardiovascular evaluation (CVE)
- Exercise treadmill stress test with complete tracings
- Current detailed narrative status report from treating physician including prognosis

### Special Considerations
- **Dissecting aneurysms:** More serious, typically require emergency surgery -- evaluated case-by-case

- **NOTE:** Some sources cite 6 months stability. The most recent FAA guidance (updated antidepressant protocol) specifies 3 months minimum. Earlier SSRI-specific guidance required 6 months. **Recommend verifying current protocol.**

#### Initial Certification Process
1. Evaluated by a HIMS-trained AME
2. Neuropsychological evaluation per FAA specifications
3. HIMS AME Checklist completion
4. FAA Certification Aid review
5. All submitted to FAA for authorization decision

#### Disqualifying Conditions
- Psychosis
- Suicidal ideation
- Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) history
- Multiple concurrent SSRIs
- Multi-agent psychiatric protocols
- Bipolar disorder

#### Discontinuation Requirements
- If stopping medication: must be off for minimum 60 days
- Favorable report from treating physician (stable mood, no side effects)
- Then may apply for regular (non-SI) issuance

### B. ADHD

#### FAA Disposition
- **Currently on ADHD medication:** Disqualifying -- cannot certify while on stimulant medications
- **Off medication for 4+ years:** "Fast Track" pathway available

#### Fast Track Requirements (Off Medication 4+ Years)
- No treatment or ADHD medication use in past 4 years
- No ADHD symptoms in past 4 years
- No instability in academic, occupational, or social functioning in past 4 years
- No other psychiatric conditions or diagnoses
- FAA ADHD Summary completed by doctoral-level (PhD or PsyD) licensed psychologist or neuropsychologist with training/experience in ADHD evaluation
- Clinical summary report from evaluating psychologist/neuropsychologist

#### CogScreen Testing
- Fast Track designed so most pilots can meet requirements **without CogScreen-AE**, unless other test results suggest it is needed
- If all criteria met: AME may ISSUE the medical certificate

### C. Anxiety and Depression (Without Medication)

#### CACI Pathway
- Situational depression or anxiety treated with **talk therapy only** (no medication) may qualify for CACI
- AME can issue without FAA review if CACI worksheet criteria are met

#### Fast Track Pathway
- FAA has provided an "Anxiety/Depression Tool for the AME" and "Fast Track Pathway" document for efficient evaluation

### General Requirements
- **Cannot certify during active treatment** -- must complete all surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy
- Condition must be considered in remission
- Cannot certify while undergoing chemotherapy or radiation

### Required Documentation
- Results of all diagnostic tests (FAA may need "raw data": videos, CDs, scans, tracings)
- Current status report from treating physician:
  - Current condition
  - Medications (dosage and frequency)
  - Treatment plan
  - Prognosis

### CACI-Eligible Cancers
- When caught early and treated, these carry high cure rates
- FAA generally asks for follow-up report from doctor at subsequent exams
- AME may issue without contacting AMCD if all CACI worksheet criteria met

## Appendix C: Uncertainty Notes

The following items could not be definitively confirmed from available online sources and should be verified against the current AME Guide or by direct consultation:

1. **Valve Replacement waiting period:** The 3-month period is stated in the valve repair protocol but may differ for replacement. The Cardiac Valve Replacement Protocol PDF (linked above) was not readable via web fetch.

2. **Antidepressant stability period:** Sources conflict between 3 months (current antidepressant protocol) and 6 months (older SSRI protocol). The most recent available guidance states 3 months.

3. **HCM eligibility for 1st/2nd class:** AMAS states HCM is currently not approvable for any class; AOPA states 3rd class only. The AME Guide lists it as requiring deferral. The precise current policy for any class should be verified.

4. **ICD policy post-2025 decision:** Whether the April 2025 ICD special issuance represents a formal policy change or a one-off legal-driven outcome is unclear.

5. **Cardiac transplant 3rd-class 12-month waiting period:** This comes from AMAS (secondary source), not directly from the AME Guide text available online.

6. **3rd Class CHD -- nuclear vs. treadmill stress test:** Under Public Law 114-190, 3rd class applicants need only a maximal exercise treadmill test (Bruce protocol), NOT nuclear/radionuclide stress testing. However, nuclear testing may be requested if there is suspicion of myocardial damage.

7. **CHD Disposition Table details:** The PDF-based disposition table was not machine-readable via web fetch. The table contains important details about specific scenarios not fully captured here.
