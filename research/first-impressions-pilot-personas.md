## PERSONA 1: DAVE

**Dave, 61, retired schoolteacher from rural Missouri. Private pilot since 1998. Flies a 1975 Cessna 172 off a grass strip, 40-50 hours/year. Had a heart attack with stent placement three weeks ago. Class 3 medical. Never heard of "special issuance" before today.**

### Page-by-Page Stream of Consciousness

#### HOMEPAGE

*[Dave opens the site on his old Dell laptop at the kitchen table, coffee getting cold]*

Okay. "MACH I." That's a clever name I guess. Medical Aerospace Cardiology and Human Performance Institute. Fancy.

"The Cardiologist Who Wrote the Book on Flying After a Heart Event."

Oh. Oh lord. That's... that's exactly what happened to me. A heart event. That's what they're calling it now. Three weeks ago I was eating a pork tenderloin sandwich at the airfield and the next thing I know I'm in an ambulance. And now this website is using the phrase "heart event" like it's something that just... happens to pilots. Like it's a thing. A normal thing. I don't know why but that makes me feel a little less like a broken old man.

"FAA Cardiovascular Specialty Consultant." So this Dr. Davenport isn't just some doctor who also sees pilots — he's the guy the FAA CALLS? That's... that's different. Doc Hendricks didn't say anything about that. He just said "good luck."

"Author of every USAF cardiac aircrew waiver guide since 2009." Military guys. If this guy was getting fighter pilots back in the air after heart problems, maybe a guy who flies a 172 to get pancakes isn't a lost cause.

Wait. "NATO Science & Technology Award winner." "100+ Publications." "Colonel USAF (Ret.)"

This guy's credentials are longer than my arm. I don't even know what half these letters mean — FACC? FAsMA? USUHS? I'm a retired social studies teacher, not a medical professional. But you know what, I don't need to know what they mean. I just need to know this guy is the real deal, and all these acronyms sure make it seem like he is.

Now let me look at what they actually do...

"Pilots Come to Us When the Stakes Are Highest." Yeah. Yeah they do. The stakes are the highest they've ever been for me right now.

"Denied or Deferred?" — Well, Doc Hendricks said my medical is suspended. Is that denied? Deferred? I don't know the difference. I wish they'd explain that.

"Need a Cardiac Eval for Flight?" — "Not just any cardiology workup. An evaluation designed from the start to meet FAA Special Issuance requirements." This is important. My cardiologist in Springfield, Dr. Kumar, she's great. She saved my life. But when I asked her about flying she looked at me like I'd asked her about my taxes. She doesn't know FAA from FDA.

"Peak Performance?" — That's not for me. That sounds like airline captain stuff or rich guys with jets.

Now the services... Let me look at prices...

"FAA AME Exam — $300." That's fine. That's normal.

"Aviation Cardiology — $600." Okay, a bit steep but not crazy.

"Special Issuance Eval — $1,200."

Twelve hundred dollars. *Dave leans back in his chair.* That's... well, that's about what I spend on the annual inspection for the 172. It's not nothing. But Betty's got her teacher's retirement and mine too, and if this is what it takes to fly again...

"Free Consultation — 1-hour phone or in-person consultation. Candidacy assessment. No obligation, no paperwork."

FREE? They'll talk to me for free first and tell me if I even have a chance? That changes everything. I don't have to commit twelve hundred dollars blind. I can call these people and just... ask. That's huge. That right there might be the thing that gets me to pick up the phone.

"Your Medical Certificate Doesn't Have to End Here." I'm trying real hard not to cry again. Betty already told me to stop crying about the airplane. She doesn't understand. She never has. Phil understands. Phil would understand why I'm sitting here at midnight looking at a cardiology website with tears in my eyes.

"Whether you've been denied, deferred, or just diagnosed — we've helped hundreds of pilots get back in the air."

Hundreds. Not five, not ten. Hundreds. And "just diagnosed" — that's me. I'm the "just diagnosed" guy.

There's a phone number — (937) 668-6974. Dayton, Ohio. That's... well, it's not next door. Springfield MO to Dayton OH is probably 8-9 hours in the truck. But they said pilots come from across the country. And they mention nearby airports including a general aviation field. Ha — if I could fly, I'd fly there. That's the cruelest irony.

#### ABOUT PAGE

*[Dave clicks "About"]*

"The Only Practice Where Both Physicians Are Subspecialists, Military Veterans, Aviators, AND FAA Consultants"

Both. There are TWO of them. And the line underneath — "That's not marketing. It's simply true." Okay, I like that. Straight talk. No fluff. Like a farmer.

"MACH I exists because pilots deserve cardiologists and pulmonologists who understand aviation. Not physicians who have to look up what a special issuance is. Not generalists who've never sat in a cockpit."

*Dave actually says "amen" out loud.*

That's EXACTLY the problem. Dr. Kumar is brilliant. She put a stent in my heart and I'm alive because of her. But she has NO idea what a special issuance is. She doesn't know what an AME is. She doesn't know the difference between Class 1 and Class 3. And why would she? But that means she can't help me get back in the air. She can help me live. This guy can help me FLY.

"Dr. Davenport is a board-certified cardiologist who serves as the FAA's Cardiovascular Specialty Consultant — the physician the FAA calls when they need to know whether a pilot with a cardiac condition can safely fly."

Let me read that again. THE physician the FAA calls. Not "a" physician. THE physician. So when the FAA is sitting there with some pilot's file, deciding whether to let him fly or ground him forever, THIS is who they call? And he's... available to help me? A retired schoolteacher with a little Cessna in rural Missouri?

"A licensed pilot." He's a pilot too! He knows what it feels like. He knows what it would mean to lose it.

"He authored every cardiac aircrew waiver guide the Air Force has used since 2009." The man literally writes the rules. And now he helps people navigate them? I mean... who better?

"Dr. Adam Young, D.O. — Lead Pulmonologist." Triple board-certified. USAF flight surgeon. Okay, well, I don't have a lung problem, but it's good to know the whole practice is built this way. Wait — there's a quote mark at the start of Dr. Young's bio that looks like it shouldn't be there. Small thing.

"Dayton, Ohio — Where Aviation Began." Nice touch. Wright brothers. I like that. I've always wanted to visit the Air Force museum there. Maybe if I have to drive out for the evaluation, I can make a trip of it. Take Betty. She might like the museum.

#### SERVICES PAGE

*[Dave clicks "Services"]*

Okay, now we're getting into the details. Let me see what's what.

They've got these tabs or sections across the top — Aviation Medicine, Cardiology, Pulmonary, Special Issuance, Performance, Other. Nice, I can find my way around.

"FAA Aviation Medical Exam (AME) — $300." Standard stuff. Vision, hearing, ECG. 45-60 minutes. Bring your MedXPress confirmation. I know all this — I've done it every couple years for 25 years.

"Free Initial Consultation." There it is again. Free. One hour. Phone OR in-person. Candidacy assessment. No obligation, no paperwork. I keep coming back to this. This is the door I'm willing to walk through.

"Aviation Cardiology Consultation — $600." Full cardiovascular evaluation with FAA-ready reporting. "Not just a cardiology workup — an evaluation designed from the start to meet FAA requirements." I've already done a cardiology workup with Dr. Kumar. But it wasn't designed for the FAA. I bet that's the problem — regular doctors don't format things the way the FAA wants them. This guy does.

Wait — "Review of outside records" — so he'd look at what Dr. Kumar already did? And then "FAA-formatted physician report." So he takes the medical information and translates it into FAA-speak. That's the whole game, isn't it?

"Aviation Pulmonology Consultation — $600." Not for me, but good to know.

"Initial Special Issuance Evaluation — $1,200." Here's the big one. Let me see what you get:
- Complete records review
- Condition-specific testing protocol
- Candidacy determination
- FAA application strategy
- Documentation package preparation
- Ongoing case management through authorization

"Ongoing case management through authorization." So they don't just do the eval and send me on my way? They stick with me through the whole process? That's... that matters. Because I have no idea what I'm doing. I'd be completely lost trying to deal with the FAA on my own.

There's also "Start Your Case" and "View Special Issuance Roadmap" links. Good, takes me to more info.

"Executive Health Screening — $599." Not for me.

"Human Performance Optimization — $2,000." DEFINITELY not for me.

"Speaking & Consulting." Oh, he does keynotes and expert witness stuff. That's nice but I'm just looking for help with my medical.

#### SPECIAL ISSUANCE PAGE

*[Dave clicks "Special Issuance" — this is the page he's been waiting for]*

"Your Roadmap Back to the Cockpit"

*Dave's hands are shaking a little.*

"A cardiac event doesn't have to end your flying career."

Doesn't HAVE to. But it COULD? How do I know if I'm one of the ones it doesn't end? I wish I knew the odds. What percentage of guys like me actually get back in the air?

"Your Cardiologist Treats Your Heart. We Get You Back in the Air."

That's the best tagline on the whole site. Perfect. That's the exact division of labor. Dr. Kumar keeps me alive. Dr. Davenport gets me flying. Two different jobs.

"FAA Special Issuance lets pilots fly again after a disqualifying cardiac event. It requires specific tests, precise timing, and documentation that speaks the FAA's language — not just a standard cardiology workup."

"Specific tests." "Precise timing." "Documentation that speaks the FAA's language." This sounds complicated. And it sounds like the kind of thing where if you get one piece wrong, the whole thing falls apart. Like doing your taxes but the penalty for a mistake is you never fly again.

"He doesn't just understand the process — he helped design it." Okay, okay. That's reassuring. If he designed the maze, he knows the way through it.

**CONDITIONS WE HANDLE**

"Coronary Heart Disease — MI, CABG, stenting, angioplasty, angina, and coronary artery disease with significant stenosis"

STENTING IS ON THE LIST. Right there. First category. MI (that's myocardial infarction, I know that now — heart attack) AND stenting. That's me. That's exactly me. I had an MI and they put in a stent. And it's listed here. It's on the list of things they handle.

I cannot tell you what a relief that is. I thought maybe a heart attack was just... game over. But it's listed here like it's just another condition they deal with. They've seen this before. They've seen guys like me before.

"Atrial Fibrillation & Flutter — The most common condition affecting pilots — highly manageable with proper documentation." Phil's brother-in-law had A-fib and lost his medical. I wonder if he knows about this place.

"Valve Replacement & Repair." "Cardiac Pacemakers." "Ventricular Arrhythmias." "Aortic Aneurysm." "Congenital Heart Disease."

They handle ALL of this? Good lord. Every heart condition I can think of is on this list.

"Not Sure Where You Fit? — Every case is different. Tell us about your situation — we'll give you an honest answer."

Honest answer. Not "we'll tell you what you want to hear." An honest answer. I appreciate that. Even if the honest answer is "Dave, you're done" — I'd rather hear it from this guy than wonder for the rest of my life.

**HOW SPECIAL ISSUANCE WORKS**

Step 1: Consultation — "Submit our intake form or contact us. We review your situation and tell you honestly whether Special Issuance is viable."

Step 2: Records & Intake — "We send a condition-specific checklist. You gather records; we handle the rest."

Step 3: Evaluation — "Comprehensive assessment — candidacy determination, testing protocol, documentation strategy."

Step 4: FAA Submission — "We prepare and submit your complete package — formatted exactly as the FAA expects."

Step 5: Authorization — "FAA reviews your case. We communicate directly with them as needed. You get cleared to fly."

Five steps. They laid it out. Consultation, records, evaluation, submission, authorization. I can understand that. I can see the path. It's not just "a whole process" like Doc Hendricks said — it's FIVE STEPS with a beginning and an end. That makes it feel possible.

But... how long does this take? From Step 1 to Step 5? Three months? Six months? A year? The site doesn't say. I really wish it did. Every day I'm not flying is a day I'm going a little crazier.

"After Your First Approval? Renewals are dramatically simpler. Through the AME Assisted Special Issuance (AASI) program, your AME can issue your certificate same-day — no FAA wait. Authorization lasts 5 years with annual follow-up testing."

Wait — AASI. What's that stand for? Oh, they actually spell it out: "AME Assisted Special Issuance." So once I get the first one, the renewals are easy? My AME — Doc Hendricks — could do it right there in Springfield? Same day? No waiting? And it's good for FIVE YEARS?

That changes the math completely. If I get through this once, I'm not doing it every year. I'm doing annual follow-up testing (whatever that means) but the cert lasts five years and renewals are easy. The $1,200 is a one-time investment, basically. Well, one-time for the hard part.

But what does "annual follow-up testing" involve? What tests? How much do they cost? Do I do them with Dr. Kumar or with this Dr. Davenport in Dayton? Another thing I wish the site explained.

#### PUBLICATIONS PAGE

*[Dave clicks "Publications"]*

"100+ Publications. NATO Award Winner. The Authority on Aviation Cardiology."

Okay. I'm a retired schoolteacher, not a doctor. I don't read medical journals. But this page does something for me anyway — it tells me this isn't some local doc who hung up a shingle. This man has published over 100 papers. He won a NATO award. He wrote a CHAPTER in the textbook that other aerospace medicine doctors learn from.

"Landmark NATO Aviation Cardiology Series — 10 Papers."

I see the paper titles. "Management of established coronary artery disease in aircrew with previous myocardial infarction or revascularisation." That's me again. Myocardial infarction — that's heart attack. Revascularisation — that's stenting. There's a paper. In a journal called Heart. Written by this guy. About people EXACTLY like me.

He didn't just treat this condition. He WROTE about it. For an international medical audience. That's... I don't even know how to process that. It's like finding out the mechanic who's going to work on your engine also wrote the engine's service manual.

Some of these have PubMed links. I don't know what PubMed is but I'm guessing it's where doctors look stuff up.

"Fundamentals of Aerospace Medicine, 5th Edition." He wrote Chapter 2: Aerospace Cardiology. THE textbook. THE chapter on hearts and airplanes.

The awards section — NATO Science & Technology Award 2024, Fellow of the Aerospace Medical Association, Fellow of the American College of Cardiology. Again, I don't know what all these mean specifically, but the picture is clear: this is the guy.

The professional leadership positions are a mile long. Consultant to the USAF Surgeon General. FAA Cardiovascular Specialty Consultant. Associate Professor. Chairman of a NATO working group.

I'll be honest — this page doesn't tell me what I NEED to know (like, "will I fly again?"). But it tells me something just as important: if anyone on Earth can help me, this is the guy. There is no one more qualified. Period.

"Available for EAA AirVenture, Sun 'n Fun." Ha — I've been to Oshkosh twice. Maybe I saw him there and didn't know it.

#### CONTACT PAGE

*[Dave clicks "Contact"]*

Clean form. First name, last name, email, phone. Service of interest dropdown — I'd pick "Special Issuance Evaluation." Pilot certificate — "Private Pilot." Message box.

Wait — there are only five or six fields. That's it? I was expecting something horrible and complicated. This is less than I fill out at the dentist.

"Respond within one business day." Good. I don't want to wait a week wondering.

Contact information: (937) 668-6974. medicalaerospacecardiology@gmail.com.

Hmm... Gmail? That's a little surprising for a medical practice. I'd expect something more... official? But then again, what do I know. Doc Hendricks uses AOL.

Hours: Monday-Friday, 8:00 AM - 5:00 PM EST. Normal business hours. No weekends, which makes sense.

"Ready to Get Started? If you already know you need an evaluation, skip ahead to our intake form." Good — they give you both options. Quick question = contact form. Ready to go = intake form.

There's a map. Dayton, OH 45459. 7061 Corporate Way, Suite 109. Suite 109 — sounds like an office park. Not a big hospital. Is that good or bad? I guess if it's a specialty practice, it doesn't need to be a hospital.

"Patients Come From Across the Country." Good. I'm not the only person driving from out of state.

"Nearby airports: Dayton International Airport (DAY), James M. Cox Dayton International Airport, Wright Brothers Airport (MGY) for general aviation."

Wright Brothers Airport! For GA! That's where I'd fly in! If I could fly! Which is the whole reason I'm on this website! *Dave shakes his head.* Life's funny sometimes.

"Hotel accommodations available within minutes of our office for out-of-town patients." Good. Betty and I would need a hotel. Two nights probably — drive up one day, eval the next, drive home after.

#### INTAKE FORM

*[Dave clicks through to the Intake form]*

"Patient Intake Form — Please complete this form to help us prepare for your evaluation. All information is kept strictly confidential."

"Privacy Notice: This form is transmitted securely via Netlify. For medical records and imaging files (which may be large), we will provide a separate HIPAA-compliant secure upload link after reviewing your intake information."

Okay. So the form itself is secure, and they'll give me a special link for the actual medical records later. That makes sense. I wouldn't want to upload my catheterization report into a regular web form anyway.

**Contact Information:** Name, email, phone, date of birth, state, mailing address. Standard.

**Aviation Background:**
- Pilot Certificate Type: They have Private Pilot. Good. Also Sport, Recreational, Commercial, ATP, Flight Instructor. Covers everybody.
- Class of Medical Needed: 3rd Class. That's me. Also 1st, 2nd, BasicMed, and "Not sure." Ha — I bet "Not sure" gets picked a lot by the scared people.
- Current Medical Certificate Status: "Currently valid," "Expired," "Denied," "Deferred," "Never held," "Revoked." Mine is... well, Doc Hendricks said suspended. I don't see "suspended" on here. Is that the same as "Deferred"? I'd probably pick that, but I'm not sure. This is the kind of thing that confuses me.

**Medical Information:**
- Primary Cardiac Condition: "Coronary Artery Disease / Heart Attack (MI)" and "Coronary Stenting / Angioplasty" — wait, those are separate options. I had BOTH. A heart attack AND a stent. Which one do I pick? I guess "Coronary Artery Disease / Heart Attack (MI)" since that's the main event and the stent was the treatment. But it's a little confusing.

- Brief Description: I can handle this. "Had a mild heart attack on January 22, 2026. Taken to hospital by ambulance. One stent placed in the LAD artery. Recovering well. Taking Plavix and a statin. Want to fly again."

- Date of Event: January 22, 2026.

- Current Cardiologist: Dr. Priya Kumar, Springfield, MO.

- Current Medications: Plavix 75mg daily, atorvastatin 40mg daily, metoprolol 25mg twice daily, aspirin 81mg daily.

**What Brings You to MACH I?**
- Primary Goal: "New Special Issuance application." That's me.
- Additional Information: "My AME told me my medical is suspended and I need a special issuance. I've never heard of this before. I'm 61, I've been flying since 1998, and this airplane is the most important thing in my life. Please help me."

*Dave stares at the submit button for a long time.*

**What Happens Next?**
1. We Review Your Intake (1-2 business days)
2. Initial Discussion (they call you)
3. Records Collection (condition-specific checklist and secure upload)
4. Evaluation Scheduled ($1,200)

They lay it out clear as day. And notice — step 2 is "we'll call YOU." I don't have to figure out when to call them. They call me. After they've already looked at my situation. So when they call, they already know my story. I don't have to start from scratch explaining what happened.

The $1,200 shows up at step 4, after they've already determined I'm a candidate. So I'm not paying twelve hundred bucks just to find out "sorry, can't help you." They tell me first, THEN I pay.

That's fair. That's really fair.

### 1. Dave's Journal Entry
*What he'd tell Phil at the diner tomorrow*

Phil, sit down. I found something last night. No, not a lump — put your coffee down and listen.

You know how Doc Hendricks told me I'm done? That I need this "special issuance" thing and it's basically impossible? Well, I couldn't sleep so I was on the computer and I found this place in Dayton, Ohio. MACH I, they call it. And Phil, this is going to sound crazy, but the doctor who runs it — Dr. Eddie Davenport — he's the guy the FAA actually calls when they need to decide if a pilot with a heart problem can fly. He's their consultant. He wrote every single cardiac waiver guide the Air Force has used since 2009. He wrote the chapter on heart stuff in the main aerospace medicine textbook. He's published over a hundred papers. He won a NATO award, Phil. A NATO award.

And he's a pilot too.

Here's the thing. They have my exact situation on their website. Heart attack, stent — it's listed right there under "Conditions We Handle." Like it's just another day at the office for them. They've done this hundreds of times. HUNDREDS.

They'll do a free phone consultation first — free, Phil, one hour — and tell me straight whether I have a shot or not. No charge, no obligation. And if I'm a candidate, the whole evaluation is twelve hundred bucks. Yeah, I know. But that includes everything — the testing, the FAA paperwork, and they stick with me all the way through until I either get my medical back or I don't. They do the FAA application for me, formatted exactly how the FAA wants it. Because this Dr. Davenport literally designed the system.

I'd have to drive to Dayton. It's about nine hours. Betty would come. But Phil — what's nine hours? What's twelve hundred dollars? Compared to never flying again?

And here's the best part — once you get approved the first time, the renewals are easy. Your regular AME can do it. Same-day certificate. Good for five years. So I wouldn't be making that drive to Dayton every year.

I'm going to call them Monday. The free consultation. I just want to hear a real person tell me I have a chance. That's all I need right now. Just someone who knows what they're talking about telling me this isn't over.

I know you think I'm foolish about that airplane, Phil. But she's all I've got that's mine, you know? Betty's got her garden and her book club. The grandkids are in Little Rock. But that 172, when I'm up there, I'm not a retired schoolteacher with a bad heart. I'm a pilot. And I'm not ready to give that up.

Pass the ketchup.

### 2. What Made Dave Feel Better

1. **"The Cardiologist Who Wrote the Book on Flying After a Heart Event"** — The headline immediately told Dave this wasn't just any cardiology practice. The word "book" and "heart event" in the same sentence communicated both expertise and normalization.

2. **Stenting explicitly listed under Conditions We Handle** — The single most important moment on the site. Seeing his exact diagnosis listed as a routine condition they address transformed his emotional state from despair to hope.

3. **"Free Initial Consultation — 1 hour, no obligation, no paperwork"** — This removed the financial risk entirely. Dave doesn't have to gamble $1,200 to find out if he has a shot. He can just call.

4. **The 5-step Special Issuance process** — Having the process laid out in numbered steps made it feel manageable instead of overwhelming. "A whole process" (Doc Hendricks' words) became "five steps."

5. **"Hundreds of pilots"** — The volume of experience. Not five, not ten. Hundreds. Dave is not a guinea pig.

6. **"He's a pilot too"** — Dr. Davenport being a licensed pilot meant he understood what's at stake emotionally, not just medically.

7. **"Your Cardiologist Treats Your Heart. We Get You Back in the Air."** — This perfectly articulated the gap Dave was experiencing: his cardiologist couldn't help with the FAA, and his AME couldn't help with the cardiology.

8. **AASI renewals being simple** — Learning that the hard part is a one-time thing, and renewals are easy through his regular AME, made the $1,200 feel like a reasonable investment rather than an annual burden.

9. **"We communicate directly with the FAA as needed"** — Dave wouldn't have to deal with the FAA himself. The practice handles it.

10. **"Respond within one business day"** / "They call YOU"** — The intake process makes it clear that after submitting the form, the practice reaches out. Dave doesn't have to navigate a phone tree or figure out what to say.

---

### 3. What Confused Dave

1. **Acronyms: FACC, FAsMA, USUHS, AASI, AME** — While AME was familiar and AASI was explained in context, FACC, FAsMA, and USUHS were never spelled out or explained. Dave doesn't need a glossary for everything, but the first occurrence of each acronym should be expanded.

2. **"Denied" vs "Deferred" vs "Suspended"** — Dave's AME told him his medical was "suspended." The site uses "denied" and "deferred" but never explains the difference. The intake form doesn't have a "suspended" option. This is a real source of confusion for someone in Dave's exact position.

3. **What a "Bruce protocol" or specific testing involves** — The site mentions "condition-specific testing protocol" but never describes what the actual tests are. For a heart attack + stent patient, what tests will the FAA require? A stress test? An echo? Dave doesn't know and the site doesn't say.

4. **How long the process takes** — This is the single biggest informational gap. From initial contact to FAA authorization: is it 3 months? 6 months? A year? Dave has no idea and the site doesn't give even a rough timeline or range.

5. **What "annual follow-up testing" means after approval** — The site mentions it but doesn't describe what tests, where they're done, or what they cost. Does Dave go back to Dayton every year? Or can Dr. Kumar do them locally?

6. **Whether Dr. Kumar's existing test results can be used** — Dave already had a cardiac catheterization, bloodwork, echocardiogram, etc. Can those records satisfy any of the FAA's requirements, or does everything have to be redone at MACH I?

7. **What "MedXPress" is** — Mentioned on the services page under the AME exam. Dave has done this before but might not remember the name. New pilots wouldn't know at all.

8. **Single vs multiple conditions on the intake form** — Dave had both an MI and stenting. The dropdown asks for "Primary Cardiac Condition" but these are listed as separate options. Which one does he pick?

9. **What "candidacy determination" actually means** — Is this a pass/fail? A probability? Does the doctor say "you have a 90% chance" or "you're a candidate" or "sorry, no"?

10. **Gmail address for a medical practice** — "medicalaerospacecardiology@gmail.com" struck Dave as informal for a practice handling sensitive medical information. Not a dealbreaker, but it made him pause.

---

### 4. What Scared Dave Off (or Made Him Hesitate)

1. **$1,200 price tag** — Even though Dave ultimately decided it was worth it, the initial sticker shock was real. For a retired schoolteacher, twelve hundred dollars is significant. The free consultation helps, but the price appearing on the homepage service cards before any context is jarring.

2. **Dayton, Ohio location** — Dave is in rural Missouri. That's a 9-hour drive. He can't fly there. The site mentions "patients come from across the country" but doesn't address the practical challenges: how many trips are required? Can any of this be done remotely/by phone? Is the evaluation a single visit or multiple?

3. **No success stories or testimonials** — Dave would be enormously reassured by hearing from someone like him who went through this process. "I had a heart attack and stent in 2023 and I'm flying again." Even one story like that would be worth ten pages of credentials.

4. **No mention of timeline or waiting periods** — The FAA has mandatory waiting periods after certain cardiac events (Dave doesn't know this yet). The site never mentions how long you have to wait after a heart attack before you can even start the process. Dave might call on Monday and find out he has to wait 6 months before they can do anything.

5. **The sheer volume of credentials feels intimidating** — This is paradoxical, but all those NATO awards and 100+ publications and Colonel rank can make a retired schoolteacher feel like this practice is for airline captains and military pilots, not a guy who flies a 1975 Cessna to get hamburgers. Dave wonders: "Is this doctor going to think my little airplane is silly? Is my case too small for him?"

6. **No photos of the doctors or office** — Dave wants to see a face. He wants to see Dr. Davenport and think "he looks like a real person, not a robot." The site has initials in circles (ED, AY) but no actual photographs. This is a significant miss for building trust with someone Dave's age.

7. **No patient journey or FAQ** — There's no "What to expect on your first visit" walkthrough, no FAQ answering common questions like "Do I need a referral?" "Will insurance cover any of this?" "How many visits will I need?" "Can I bring my spouse?"

---

### 5. What Dave Wished Was There

1. **A timeline estimate** — "Most heart attack/stent patients can begin the process X months after their event. The typical case takes X-X months from consultation to FAA authorization." Even a range would help enormously.

2. **Success stories / testimonials** — "I had a heart attack at 58 and Dr. Davenport got me back in the air in 8 months" would be the most powerful content on the entire site.

3. **A simple FAQ page** covering:
   - Do I need a referral?
   - Will insurance cover any of this?
   - How many trips to Dayton will I need?
   - Can anything be done remotely?
   - How long does the whole process take?
   - What's the approval rate for cases like mine?
   - Is there a waiting period after my event before I can start?
   - What if I get denied?
   - Can I use my existing test results from my local cardiologist?
   - What does "annual follow-up testing" involve after approval?

4. **Photos of the doctors and the office** — Real photos, not stock. Dave wants to see the person he's trusting with his flying future.

5. **A "patients like you" section** — Brief profiles of typical cases (anonymized): "A 62-year-old private pilot with MI and stent — approved in 7 months." "A 45-year-old airline captain with A-fib — approved in 4 months." This would help people self-identify and calibrate expectations.

6. **Insurance information** — Is any of this covered? Will they bill insurance? Is it all out of pocket? For Dave on a teacher's retirement, this matters a lot.

7. **A glossary or plain-English explanations** — Not a separate page necessarily, but tooltips or parenthetical explanations for terms like "special issuance," "AASI," "Bruce protocol," etc.

8. **Information about what happens if you're NOT a candidate** — The site is very focused on getting you approved. But what if the honest answer is "no"? What are Dave's options then? BasicMed? Light sport? The site should address this, because it would actually increase trust — it shows they're not just taking everyone's money.

9. **A phone number that's more prominent on mobile** — Dave might be looking at this on his phone. A sticky "Call Now" button that follows you down the page would help.

10. **Some mention of emotional support or understanding** — One sentence like "We know what it feels like to face losing your medical. We've been there with hundreds of pilots, and we understand this isn't just paperwork — it's your life." The site is very competent and professional but could use one more human moment.

### 6. Would Dave Call / Fill Out the Form?

**YES. Dave would call.**

Here's the reasoning: The free consultation is the tipping point. Dave would not fill out the intake form first — that feels too committal, too official, too much like "starting" before he's ready. But a phone call? A free phone call where someone who actually knows what they're talking about tells him straight whether he has a chance? Dave would do that.

He'd call Monday morning at 8:05 AM EST. He'd be nervous. He'd probably rehearse what he's going to say. He'd probably write notes on a legal pad. "Had a heart attack January 22. One stent. LAD artery. 61 years old. Private pilot. Class 3 medical. Cessna 172. Want to fly again. Is there hope?"

The site gave Dave three things he needed:
1. **Hope** — stenting is on the list, they've done this hundreds of times
2. **A credible authority** — the credentials are overwhelming in the right way
3. **A low-risk first step** — the free consultation means he can get answers without spending a dime

If the free consultation goes well and they tell him he's a candidate, Dave would fill out the intake form that same day. The $1,200 would not stop him — he'd find the money. He might sell the boat motor that's been sitting in the barn.

### 7. Dave's Verdict

I'll tell you what, Phil. I spent a couple hours on this website last night and for the first time since the heart attack, I feel like maybe — MAYBE — I'm not done flying. This Dr. Davenport is the real deal. He's not some guy with a website making promises. He's the actual person the FAA calls about hearts and airplanes. He wrote the book. Literally. And they've got my exact situation listed on their website like it's just Tuesday for them. Now, it's going to cost twelve hundred dollars, and I'll have to drive to Dayton, and I still don't know how long it'll take or even if I'll qualify. The website could do a better job telling you what to expect — like how long the process is and what the tests are and whether guys like me usually get through. And they don't have any pictures of the doctor, which is weird. But you know what? They'll talk to me for free on the phone, for an hour, and tell me straight. And that's all I need right now. Someone who knows what they're talking about to look at my situation and tell me the truth. Even if the truth hurts. Because right now I'm just sitting in the dark guessing, and that's the worst thing of all. I'm calling Monday. And if they tell me there's a chance, I'll drive to Ohio. Betty can come too. There's a Wright Brothers museum there. She'd like that.

## PERSONA 2: MARIA

**Maria, 45, airline captain (ATP, Class 1 medical). Recently diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. Career on the line. Sophisticated, knows the FAA system somewhat, evaluating this practice vs her airline's medical department.**

---

### Key Reactions by Page

**Homepage:**
- "FAA Cardiovascular Specialty Consultant. Okay, that's not nothing. Our airline medical department has a list of approved cardiologists, but I doubt any of them are THE FAA consultant."
- "Colonel USAF, NATO award — this is top shelf. Our chief pilot would be impressed by these credentials."
- "Free consultation — smart. I need to know my options before I tell the airline anything. Timing matters here."
- "$1,200 for the special issuance eval... my airline might cover this. And if not, what's $1,200 against a $280K salary?"

**About:**
- "He's a pilot. Good. He'll understand why I need my First Class, not just any medical."
- "Both physicians are military veterans, FAA consultants, AND pilots. I've never seen that combination anywhere."
- "The practice is in Dayton. I can route a trip through DAY easily. Or just deadhead."
- "I need to know: does he have experience with airline pilots specifically? First Class medicals have different standards. The site doesn't distinguish between certificate classes."

**Special Issuance:**
- "'Atrial Fibrillation & Flutter — The most common condition affecting pilots — highly manageable with proper documentation.' MANAGEABLE. That's the word I needed."
- "But 'highly manageable' isn't 'guaranteed.' What's the success rate for A-fib special issuance on a First Class medical specifically?"
- "The 5-step process is clear. But I need to know the timeline. My airline has a maximum grounding period before they start paperwork on me. Every day counts."
- "AASI for renewals — so after the first approval, my AME at the airline can handle it? That would be ideal."

**Publications:**
- "Management of cardiac conduction abnormalities and arrhythmia in aircrew — that's my paper. He literally wrote the NATO-level guidance on my condition."
- "I'm going to pull these papers on PubMed and read them. I want to understand the clinical criteria before I talk to this practice."
- "The European Heart Journal publication adds credibility. These are top-tier journals."

**Services:**
- "I'm not interested in the AME exam here — my airline has that covered. What I need is the special issuance evaluation and someone who can get my First Class back."
- "The $600 aviation cardiology consultation might be a good first step if I'm not ready to commit to the full $1,200."
- "No mention of whether they work with airline medical departments or HIMS programs. For airline pilots, this is an important coordination point."

**Contact/Intake:**
- "The intake form has 'Airline Transport Pilot (ATP)' as an option. Good, they know we exist."
- "'1st Class' is an option under medical class. Also good."
- "But the form doesn't ask about my employer, union, or whether my airline medical department is involved. For an airline pilot, that coordination is critical."

**What Maria Wishes Were There:**
- Success rate data, especially for First Class medicals with A-fib
- Specific timeline estimates (critical for airline pilots facing career deadlines)
- Information about coordination with airline medical departments
- Whether they've worked with specific airlines or the HIMS program
- Telehealth or remote consultation options (Maria is based in Atlanta)
- Whether they can provide letters for the airline as well as the FAA

**Would Maria Call?**
YES, but she'd do her homework first. She'd pull the PubMed papers, read them, then schedule the free consultation. She'd probably also call her airline medical department to understand their process, and she might check with her union (ALPA) to see if they have a recommendation. The free consultation is perfect for Maria — she needs to assess this practice's fit for her specific situation before committing. She'd want to know: "Have you done First Class special issuance for airline pilots with A-fib? How many? What was the timeline and success rate?" If the answers are strong, she'd move forward immediately. Maria is decisive, well-funded, and motivated — but she's also smart enough to evaluate her options before committing.

**Maria's One-Line Verdict:**
"The credentials are unmatched — nobody else has this combination of FAA consulting authority, clinical expertise, and published research on my exact condition. I just need to know the timeline, because my airline won't wait forever."

## PERSONA 3: JAKE

**Jake, 34, student pilot. Just diagnosed with insulin-dependent (Type 1) diabetes right before his checkride. Devastated. Doesn't even know if he can still get a medical. Very little money. Found this site through Reddit.**

---

### Key Reactions by Page

**Homepage:**
- "The Cardiologist Who Wrote the Book on Flying After a Heart Event... wait, this is cardiology. I have diabetes. Is this even the right place?"
- "Cardiac event. Cardiac. Heart. I don't have a heart problem. I have diabetes. Is this place for me?"
- "FAA Cardiovascular Specialty Consultant... pulmonology... I don't see endocrinology anywhere on this site. My thing isn't a heart thing."
- "'Free Consultation' — well, at least I could ask if they can even help me."
- "$1,200 for special issuance... I make $18/hour as a warehouse associate. I've already spent $14,000 on flight training. I literally cannot afford this."

**About:**
- "Board certified cardiology. Triple board-certified pulmonary medicine. Where's the diabetes doctor? Nowhere."
- "These guys are incredibly qualified for heart and lung problems. But my problem is my pancreas."
- "Wait — it says FAA AME. They're an AME. So could they at least do my medical exam and know what they're looking for with diabetes?"

**Special Issuance:**
- "Conditions We Handle: Coronary Heart Disease, Valve Replacement, Atrial Fibrillation, Pacemakers, Ventricular Arrhythmias, Aortic Aneurysm, Congenital Heart Disease... no diabetes. It's all heart stuff."
- "'Not Sure Where You Fit? — Every case is different. Tell us about your situation.' Maybe I fit there? But everything else on this page is about hearts."
- "I feel like I walked into a heart hospital looking for a diabetes specialist. This isn't the place for me."

**Services:**
- "Aviation Cardiology. Aviation Pulmonology. Nothing about endocrinology or metabolic conditions."
- "The 'Free Initial Consultation' says 'candidacy assessment for special issuance.' Could I just... call and ask if they handle diabetes at all? They might say no, but at least I'd know."

**Contact/Intake:**
- "The intake form lists cardiac conditions. The only non-cardiac options are 'Pulmonary condition' and 'No cardiac/pulmonary condition (other service).' I'd have to pick 'other service' I guess."
- "This form feels like it wasn't designed for me at all."

**What Jake Wishes Were There:**
- ANY mention of diabetes, metabolic conditions, or endocrine issues
- A clear statement of what conditions they do and DON'T handle
- A referral suggestion: "If your condition isn't cardiac or pulmonary, here are other resources..."
- The AOPA medical help page or similar resource for non-cardiac conditions
- Some indication of whether BasicMed is an option for student pilots (it's not, but Jake doesn't know that)
- A payment plan or any acknowledgment that cost is a barrier

**Would Jake Call?**
MAYBE. Jake would probably stare at the free consultation offer and think about calling just to ask. But the entire site is so clearly cardiac/pulmonary focused that he'd likely feel like he's wasting their time. He might send a contact form message instead — less confrontational than a phone call for a 34-year-old. His message would be something like: "I know you specialize in hearts but I have Type 1 diabetes and I'm a student pilot about to take my checkride. Can you help me at all, or can you point me to someone who can?"

More likely, Jake would go back to Reddit and keep searching.

**Jake's One-Line Verdict:**
"This place is obviously the best in the world at getting pilots with heart problems flying again, but I have diabetes, and there's nothing on this site that tells me they can help with that — or even who I should call instead."

## CROSS-PERSONA SYNTHESIS: Top Recommendations for the Site

### Must-Have Additions

1. **Timeline estimates for the special issuance process.** All three personas wanted this. Even a range ("Most cases take 4-12 months depending on condition and FAA processing times") would be transformative.

2. **Success stories / testimonials.** Dave needs emotional reassurance, Maria needs data points, and even Jake would benefit from seeing the breadth of cases handled. HIPAA-compliant anonymized stories would suffice.

3. **Photos of the doctors.** The site builds enormous credibility through text but has zero visual trust-building. A professional headshot of Dr. Davenport and Dr. Young would significantly increase conversion for people like Dave.

4. **FAQ page.** Insurance, number of visits, remote options, what to bring, what happens if denied, referrals for non-cardiac conditions.

5. **A clear scope statement.** The site should explicitly say what conditions they handle AND what they don't — with referral suggestions for conditions outside their scope (diabetes, mental health, neurological, substance abuse). Jake represents a real segment of desperate searchers who will land on this site.

### Should-Have Improvements

6. **Explain "denied" vs "deferred" vs "suspended"** — these terms are used interchangeably by AMEs but mean different things to the FAA. A brief explanation would help people like Dave self-identify.

7. **Expand acronyms on first use** — FACC, FAsMA, USUHS, AASI (AASI is expanded, the others are not).

8. **Add an estimated approval timeline section on the Special Issuance page** — even if it's "varies by condition, typically X-Y months."

9. **Mention insurance/payment explicitly** — even if it's "Most aviation medical evaluations are not covered by insurance. We accept [payment methods]."

10. **Professional email domain** — The Gmail address is a minor credibility issue that's easy to fix (e.g., info@machicardiology.com).

### Nice-to-Have Enhancements

11. **"Am I a candidate?" self-screening quiz** — Simple, 5-question decision tree that tells people whether MACH I is likely the right resource for them.

12. **BasicMed and Sport Pilot information** — For people who may not qualify for special issuance, mentioning alternatives shows the practice is looking out for the patient, not just selling a service.

13. **Virtual/telemedicine options** — Especially for the initial consultation, being explicit about phone vs video vs in-person options would help out-of-state patients.

14. **Links to AOPA and FAA resources** — Showing awareness of the broader pilot support ecosystem would build trust and help people like Jake who may need different resources.
