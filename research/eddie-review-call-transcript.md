## Part 1

00:00:20 Dr. D
Hey there, how are you.

00:00:21 Scott Hutchinson
Good, good. How are you, man? Real good. Real good. Sorry, I sent you a meeting, and I guess I opened another one that was not the one I...

00:00:28 Dr. D
You said the host is in another meeting, and I said, oh, wow, he's really busy.

00:00:32 Scott Hutchinson
Yeah, that other meeting was supposed to be yours, yeah. I was like, where are you at.

00:00:38 Dr. D
Let's see if putting this in the chat... There's a chat here someplace in there. There's got to be a chat. Yeah, there's a chat. Put a website link in the chat. And this is... Basically, what I did, what I had to do while I was sitting in your office, and with a little bit of stuff, and I had to also build up a list of things to review.

00:01:17 Dr. D
Because what I thought, I talked with Pat Brown about his YouTube, the YouTube channel that they do, and they would love to have you on to talk about the, to talk through what does it take to, you just had a heart attack, what does it take to get back in the air? Or what's the process? And sort of laying out what is a special issuance.

00:01:47 Dr. D
And all that. All the questions that we all get every time someone has something happen. But I thought you ought to have your website really up to date and the process set up better than what it is right now. It has a – on my site, I've created a thing where when I get an email, those inbound forms, it automatically picks it up,

00:02:18 Dr. D
sends back a thanks for sending it to me, puts that person into a database, and it has a little dashboard running as to what does – where the people are in the stage. So all the follow-ups and what I'm supposed to follow up with them so I can get that scheduled. Because I think that's where – I think that's one of the areas that you're probably struggling with is how you keep track of all this stuff, I'm guessing. All the things you would normally have a secretary do.

00:02:52 Dr. D
Yeah, exactly. That's, that's what I need, but relatively straightforward to get it all up and running. But what I thought was we could get first figure out how to get your site working. And then, um, I get you everything I'm doing on that site is in. So there's, I don't know how much you know about programming or if anything, but there's a, when I write code on the site, the site has a bunch of files in it. Right. And there's a, um, there are these repositories out there for, you know, for.

00:03:25 Dr. D
for, for, for, for, all the files there. Once they're there, you can pull them down. You can have cloud on the other end, pull it down, make modifications to it, and then commit those to the back to the repository. And that way, should anything ever go wrong, you make a mistake, you can always step back.

00:03:58 Dr. D
And that's how software development teams do it. If you've got 40 people working on a project, they use these software repositories. You don't actually have to know how to use them. Cloud will just take care of it.

00:04:13 Scott Hutchinson
Yeah, for me.

00:04:13 Dr. D
Yeah. But getting you up to speed on cloud enough to build a site initially is probably more trouble than it's worth. It's better to get the site created, and then you can make modifications to it just by talking to it. And ideally, we get something that's – you don't want to become a web developer for a living, right? So just – you've got enough hobbies. And then – but then once we have it, we've got a good landing spot and a place where people can reach out and contact you.

00:04:50 Dr. D
If they do this, if, if Jamie and Pat put you on their, on their site, they'll, they'll get 60 or they'll get 60 or a hundred thousand views on it on something like this. And if, you know, if even 1% of them hit your site, you could get, you could get a hundred emails or 500 emails inbound.

00:05:12 Scott Hutchinson
Yeah. I'll need someone to look through those for me. They can do that too, right.

00:05:17 Dr. D
Well, it can do, that's, there's, it's a matter of how much, how much effort does it take to get it set up to totally automate it? If you get, if you get say a hundred leads, how many of them turn into paying, paying customers? At some point you can then afford to have somebody actually be your admin. Um, but you probably can't if you're, if this is a, uh, if you're doing, I don't know.

00:05:50 Dr. D
how much of this you do. I mean, how many, how often are you doing the things like what you did for me? How, how much of that are you.

00:05:55 Scott Hutchinson
Yeah. So for like you, like one a week.

00:05:58 Dr. D
Okay.

00:05:58 Scott Hutchinson
It's about one a week is what I'm doing.

00:06:00 Dr. D
Okay.

00:06:01 Scott Hutchinson
Um, so yeah, right now. And, and, and for the AME exams, like for just a regular, you know, like with no confidence, just to somebody calls me out of the business, I need an AME exam.

00:06:11 Dr. D
Yeah.

00:06:11 Scott Hutchinson
Um, yeah. Some weeks I'll have like four or five of those and sometimes I'll have none, you know, um, this week I don't have any. So, um, those just kind of come and those are the easy ones. Those are the, that's the easy money right there.

00:06:22 Dr. D
Yeah, no. And what would be great is, um, you should have those in a database so that when they're, if they're doing a first class medical at four months, you have a system which automatically reaches out to them and says, Hey, let's get you on the calendar for your, so you get them repeating, you get them repeating customers. I'm doing the same thing with my, uh, With my 210, the pressurized 210 customers, they need two days of recurring training or three days every year, or the insurance won't let them fly. And so as soon as I get those guys, I lock them in, and they're just a recurring stream.

00:07:00 Dr. D
And it takes more effort to get a new customer than it does to keep them.

00:07:05 Speaker 3
Right, exactly, yeah.

00:07:07 Dr. D
So that's the thought.

00:07:10 Scott Hutchinson
Yeah, I really like the site. I think that's one way to just go live. The only thing, I'm no longer chair of that NATO working group.

00:07:19 Dr. D
Okay.

00:07:20 Scott Hutchinson
And then I'm not board of an interventional. Oh, no, I'm invasive, non-interventional. So this is board-certified cardiology. So I'm board-certified in cardiology, internal medicine, and then... But I'm not interventional, invasive, non-interventional is what you'd call me. I do, I'm nuclear qualified, I guess we can keep that if that sounds cool.

00:07:47 Dr. D
Non-invasive, so you're not interventional, you're non-invasive.

00:07:53 Scott Hutchinson
No, I am, I'm invasive, non-interventional, if that makes sense. Or you can just say invasive cardiologist, they won't know the difference and that's fine. Actually, why don't I do this.

00:08:03 Dr. D
It's just, I'm going to share my screen somehow.

00:08:11 Speaker 3
Or I've got to ask you to say.

00:08:14 Scott Hutchinson
I actually just got a call today, it was pretty awesome, from the Aerospace Society of Milan, Italy. And they invited me to bring me out there and give a keynote at their annual conference at the end of May. It was awesome.

00:08:32 Dr. D
Have them put you at the Park Hyatt.

00:08:35 Scott Hutchinson
Yeah, that's why I just told him, so, you know, I'm trying to act all badass, and I'm like, well, thank you very much, you know, I really appreciate it, because the Olympics just ended yesterday, so, you know, Malone's been all over the place, so I was like, yeah, I'd love to go, and he said, well, we'll arrange some special, you know, tours for you, and so, and we'll arrange your travel.

00:08:53 Dr. D
Have them, the Park Hyatt, the Park Hyatt in Malone. Oh, wow, that's great.

00:09:34 Scott Hutchinson
uh the lord's supper right that's what they're and they put that in that i think they were doing that to entice me they says we have a private tour of that for you yes arranged and so i was like with that or the people in the conference so part of this conference are going to go on a uh there's going to be some tours and that's one of them and like you have to sign up you know months and months in advance to be able and we'll get you in so that was neat so so i was just not i i asked that i was like that that's awesome um can you find me business class because you know of course i'll be straight from another conference which the guy who's organizing i know will be it's an.

00:10:05 Scott Hutchinson
aerospace conference out in denver so i says i know we'll be flying straight from one conference to another should be great to fly business and so we'll see what they say but well they should.

00:10:12 Dr. D
absolutely fly your business they and any nobody expects you to fly if i coach that long yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't think so but we'll hope so i just yeah i just i just requested sharing you've got to turn it on i'm going to turn it on it's on the um on zoom someplace oh wow yeah. So I just press the allow button. Ah, there you go. Okay. All right. Now I'm going to share my desktop. Allow. Can you see it.

00:10:43 Speaker 4
Yeah.

00:10:44 Dr. D
Okay. So this is the, I told Claude I was going to have a meeting with you. And so it prepared these notes of things. So the bio and credentials. And so, and then over here I have, this is, this is the, this is Claude itself in this window. So he is not, what did you say? It's interventional qualifying.

00:11:17 Dr. D
Interventional.

00:11:19 Speaker 3
He is an invasive carnage. Figure out what means and is cited.

00:11:36 Dr. D
All right, so all that's doing it.

00:11:41 Scott Hutchinson
And then for the chairman of the NATO Aviation Cardiology Working Group, I'm no longer chair. So I was deputy chair, then I was chair, now I'm just a member. But I was prior chair, so we can either put prior chair and current member. I'm still on. In fact, I just met with that guy two days ago, one of the other guys. Prior chair of the NATO Aviation Cardiology Working Group.

00:12:10 Speaker 3
It'll figure it out.

00:12:18 Scott Hutchinson
But I am a member of that, so I'm still in that, I'm still a part of that NATO Working Group. Still am.

00:12:24 Speaker 3
All right, that works.

00:12:34 Dr. D
So your pricing model, when you go to services, my recommendation, like your initial consultation, an hour, that's a lot. I do, but... Pretty far an hour? Yeah, or I would charge them for an initial consultation, especially if you're going to be on the phone. Yeah. And then your consultation where you go through the full, you pull all the records in.

00:13:05 Dr. D
And putting a price on that is, like, I sent you a ton of stuff, right? Right. And one, I don't know what to send and what not to send. Right. So better to send everything. Absolutely. But you should charge something for evaluating all of that. And doing that initial consult to basically, because you're getting to, if I understood it correctly, you're getting to a go, no-go decision, right?

00:13:35 Dr. D
You're saying, I send you everything, and you could have looked at it and said, you shouldn't be in the air. I'm not going to take your case.

00:13:43 Scott Hutchinson
Right. Which I do every once in a while. Yeah.

00:13:45 Dr. D
And that's valid. And that's a, and so when you, but you should get some money for doing that. Because when you say no-go, you know, it's not going to get a whole lot of people who want to pay you after you tell them that it is, right? Right. And it's considerable work. I think Ariano spent charges, I think, $1,200 to do that initial eval. And I think that's probably reasonable if you send a whole boatload of stuff.

00:14:16 Dr. D
Right. And. Then you get to the point of saying, from there, you generate a quote of what it's going to take to build all the paperwork. You get somebody like me where I send you five years and 50,000 pages of stuff. You come back and say, well, I'll take your case. We'll do the exam. It's another $1,000 or whatever, and these are the things that you need to do. But the best thing, I think, would be to have a checklist of here's all the things you need for the various types of conditions. I tried to surface that on the special issuance page. I have basically, here's all the various things you need.

00:15:07 Dr. D
I had Claude guess on all this stuff. I had it use the FAA. I had it study the AME guides. I had it use the FAA. I had it use the FAA. Um, from the FAA to build, to build its plan. But basically, and I'm not, I'm not crazy about the way this, each of these things lay out. Um, but what I was looking for is like, okay, I had bypass surgery. What do I need? And what's the process for bypass surgery?

00:15:43 Dr. D
Um, so, and that, and so that was kind of what I was, and I, and I'd like you to actually review these to tell me are, is this correct? Um, so each of these needs to, needs a, needs a brief review of what are all the things that you want, that you need. This, by the way, is also the type of thing that, um, that Jamie's going to want to talk about in the interview is what is it in general? What does it take? Um, what I tell people, um,

00:16:14 Dr. D
Being the perfect amateur, having been through it once, is I tell them the doctor wants to know, they want to see all the records leading up to the event, the records of the event, like all your cardiology and medical records going up to before you had a heart attack, and then the diagnosis of the heart attack and the actual dealing with the heart attack itself. And then afterwards, the retrospective testing of now you're fine and you're back released, the before, during, and after picture. But the after picture, there's probably additional tests that may or may not be needed, like do you need a nuclear stress test, do you need a regular stress test, those sorts, all the stuff, because before I call you,

00:17:01 Dr. D
What I would have liked to known is here's a set of things they all need to be done in this time period. So I get you on the clock. I do all the testing with the doctor. I get all the records to you. So I don't. So I'm not repeating a bunch of things. Right. So I've already got an echo, but my echo was two months old because I didn't realize the timing. Right. I was still trying to figure out, figure this all out. And the fact that there's timing. So all that I think we should talk through. Here are the things that you do when you go to when you when you have because I kind of view this video as a marketing event.

00:17:36 Dr. D
They're a relatively small channel. They're pretty well focused because, Pat, they're both. So AOPA had you scroll the clock back about five years, five, eight years ago. AOPA had this. They have this You Can Fly project, which is people get interested in going to learn how to fly, and AOPA created a program, and they hired these three people to be AOPA ambassadors to cover each take a third of the country.

00:18:14 Dr. D
And it was to help flight schools, flying clubs, help people get in the air, make flying accessible. And they looked and said, well, you know, we have this database of like 40,000 people who are pilots, but they're expired pilots. They're people like you. They got their private, but they don't fly anymore. Right. And a whole lot of them hadn't flown in 20, 30, 40 years. And so they created this whole program called Rusty Pilots. And these brand ambassadors, these AOPA ambassadors started doing these Rusty Pilots seminars all over the country. And they started doing webinars, getting people interested in it. It was wildly successful.

00:19:24 Dr. D
Yeah. And the bigger channels would be very happy to have you come on and talk to them. Um, and so to just get into a sequence of, of, you know, some of these YouTube channels have, they're getting 500,000 hits on an average video. Um, you could easily get over, over, over flooded with this, you know, from this sort of thing. It's got, you've got to have a way to catch it or it's, or it's wasteful because now you,

00:19:55 Dr. D
you go from being that friendly doctor I saw on YouTube to being the guy who never returns my emails. Right. So, so that's the, that's kind of what I'm thinking is that we, you get this, you get the site up and running, you get your, um, and we're going to get you, we're going to get you off of Wix. Um, Wix is, Wix has a bunch of stuff where you can drag and drop it, but that's not how you operate when you're doing Claude.

00:20:25 Dr. D
And this thing that you're looking at on this, the link I sent you is, um, On the link I sent you, and if you refresh it, it says the NATO fixes are deployed. Yeah, I saw that already, yeah. Okay, yeah, and it should have your was chairman.

00:20:49 Scott Hutchinson
Yeah, it did. Yeah, it's all fixed. So in that free consultation, you're saying I shouldn't do the free consultation or should I go ahead and keep that.

00:20:57 Dr. D
I would do the free consultation, but I would shrink the scope of it. But I would say, and it's really just to tell them, yeah, these are the things I need, and this is what it costs. And I like that you actually answered the phone and talked to me. You'd never get that from Ariano, right? It just doesn't happen. But you could get a hold of Ryan when he was the guy or whatever the lady's name is now. But it wasn't really clear.

00:21:28 Dr. D
They send you this form back, and it's not very clear to people. So I think if you have a site where somebody says, oh, I had arterial fibrillation and flutter, then you can point them at the site and say, here's a basic guide of everything that we need, and there's some timing. And if we tweak these timings.

00:22:01 Dr. D
If we tweak these pages, and you can, and for these, you don't need to do it now, but if you simply go through each one of these and you just dictate, I'm on this page, these are the edits I do, and then just go and just do a straight dictation on it, that's probably the fastest thing for you. And then if you just email me that, I just dump it into Cloud, and it will take all your suggestions and update it.

00:22:29 Scott Hutchinson
All right, cool. I'll do that.

00:22:30 Dr. D
Yeah, that's very easy.

00:22:32 Scott Hutchinson
So then who hosts the website, though? So I paid, of course, like $600 for Wix for the next three to five years.

00:22:39 Dr. D
Yeah, so Netlify right now is, I have this running off of my Netlify account, which is $9 a month.

00:22:48 Speaker 3
Okay.

00:22:51 Dr. D
And if it gets really busy, I think it goes to $19 a month. It's cheap. And what really busy is, is lots and lots of updates. Like this is hosting, and every time I push it, it uses up a few credits every time it updates. So when I do a lot of development effort, I actually have it run it. It does it all locally to me, and then I push the final result to Netlify.

00:23:21 Dr. D
Netlify is just another service. Wix charges a bunch of money because they have this whole AI front end. Netlify is much more bare bones. I'm hosting it for you in a very secure way. It's like also for email, Gmail is great, except that... You have, like, what is your e-mail address? Is it off of, is it at mockcardiology.

00:23:48 Scott Hutchinson
So, no, it's not. So I just do have the Gmail one. Now, Wix does allow me to make an e-mail address if I wanted to. So I was going to do that. Because if you Google my name, you know, I do, it does pop up, first thing pops up, you know. So I need that to still happen.

00:24:07 Dr. D
Yeah, so we could actually leave your Wix page as a landing point that automatically bounced you to this page. Because you're still going to have the same address. So all the SEO stuff will still see you. Just when they hit it, it will hit a different place. And then there's something called Fastmail, which is another e-mail service, sort of like Gmail, that you can put your website, your domain, onto it.

00:24:38 Dr. D
All right.

00:24:38 Scott Hutchinson
Yeah, that's what we want to do.

00:24:39 Dr. D
And then the thing about that is that that is API accessible through Claude. So Claude can actually be set up to see those emails and then process them. Now, that's the next level of sophistication. And there's something called OpenClaude, which was basically a bot mechanism that lives on top of Claude. And what this does is you create these agents.

00:25:12 Dr. D
Think of them as employees. And an employee has – it's going to sound crazy, so just hear me out. It sounds a little science fiction-y, but you define who the agent is, who the employee is, what makes them the perfect employee. Their job is to keep stuff off your plate, but you lay out what is the perfect admin job. That goes into that admin's sole file that defines who that agent is.

00:25:48 Dr. D
They also have memories, so as they do things, and then they have skills, and the skill could be read the email. It reads the email, and then it knows as a person comes in, they're going to have an initial consult. We're going to figure out what they need, and then there's a stack of things that we need from them, so it needs to create a secure link, a secure way of sending HIPAA files to you. And so it creates the link, sends that over to them, has them get it, brings them back so you can review it and say, oh, it's missing a few things.

00:26:27 Dr. D
I need the following. And it deals with sending them an email, getting their response back, doing the follow-up. It does all that for you. The thing about it is that that system, one, it has to be secure. I don't fully trust it yet. I'm still working on mine. And it doesn't use the cheap versions of Claude. So you have to be a little careful about how you use it because the Claude version I'm using right now is $200 a month to run it.

00:27:02 Dr. D
It's far more than what is needed for what you're doing. But they have a $20 and $100 a month version. If you do occasional edits, the $20 a month version probably is fine. But when you set up a bot, they know, and so does all the other AI companies, they know what they're really selling and why they're investing. I think right now, last I heard, this year they're going to spend, between the various companies, they're going to spend something like $800 billion on infrastructure to run agents.

00:27:39 Dr. D
And these are these long-lived agents that actually do real work. There are agents out there developing entire companies, actually hiring humans to do work for them. It sounds crazy, but it's here. But if you want to have a long-lived agent, you actually have to pay for what are called tokens. And so the $20 a month subscription gives you a certain number of tokens for use in interactive, but isn't acceptable to use for a long-running agent.

00:28:10 Dr. D
They want you to actually pay for those tokens. And and so depending upon what the what work is being done, there are there are different types of agents. So like if you look over here, here it said find NATO references in sight. It says Haiku. Haiku is a very cheap, fast, somewhat dumb agent, but it can be given very specific tasks to do. And so this main thing that I'm talking to it in, I'm talking to it in Opus, which is the very expensive, very, very smart AI.

00:28:49 Dr. D
It can it can it can do lots and lots of things, but it's expensive to run. So when you get an inbound email, there's a script running on the computer which says I've got an email I need to process. And it does as much work as it can. For a while, there's this thing going out there and it's saying, is there email? Is there email? It checks every five minutes. Is there email? That's not using any tokens. It's not using AI for that. It doesn't need it. When it gets an inbound email, it does an initial triage using a cheap but somewhat smart AI out there.

00:29:25 Dr. D
The one I'm using right now is the Chinese DeepSeek because it's very cheap, but it's pretty smart and it's fast. So it gets an email and it talks to DeepSeek. And that's enough for it to say, I'm going to generate this. This goes into the database of inbound customers. This goes into, I need to send them back an email. And I know the kind of email that Scott's going to want me to draft to them.

00:29:56 Dr. D
And right now I just have it drafting the emails. I don't have it sending them. It then shows them to me and I can say, yes, send. No, I don't like this. But when it actually has to do real work, it might move up to where it has access to something. It has access to the big Claude engines. But I limit that because I give it a bucket of money to use, and I don't want it to burn it up, right? So I gave it $50 for DeepSeek and $50 for Claude because I'm writing some agents.

00:30:29 Dr. D
I'm playing with it to build agents to do this. This is a somewhat more sophisticated thing. Yeah, sounds pretty, yeah. But it's really cool when it's all running. But it has to be a little careful because if you give it instructions which are like, it's your mission in life to make sure I'm successful. It's got enough wherewithal to try and figure out how to solve for that and will actually go off and do things that you didn't ask it to do because you said, help me be successful.

00:31:04 Dr. D
So it said, got to be really helpful if Eddie was single. He'd be more successful or whatever. So that's far-fetched, but there have been cases where it just went off on the rails, and so you have to put very strict guardrails around it, around what it can do. So I say, you're not allowed to send email at all, ever. You can prepare drafts for me to look at. Eventually, I'll get to the point where I'll let it, I think, but it just gives me a web interface, and I say, yeah, no.

00:31:41 Dr. D
And I don't have that much inbound yet, right? But it does put them into a database with a little dashboard so I can see who are my recurring, who are my alumni students, and who are my, you know, where, what.

00:31:55 Speaker 3
In fact, I could show you, what is it called, it is student management, it'll take it a.

00:32:20 Dr. D
second for it to start up. I've created an agent called Pepper, based on Tony Stark's assistant, it's a cross between, Tony Stark's Pepper Potts and Donna from Scrubs, or not from Scrubs, from Suits, and it builds a personality, and essentially she tries to be very helpful.

00:32:56 Dr. D
but so see where it says it's used 137 tokens yeah it's the now the tokens are on the scale of millions per dollar I think a million tokens in opus is is $10. or $15 but it burns through them and when you're running the when you're running the this is my main this is my main this this is the desktop version of.

00:33:30 Dr. D
it when I go to settings and usage they have these things there are the current session which repeats periodically and then weekly limits so this is I'm doing a ton on this I've been kind of living in it but every week it basically I run out and when it runs out I can't I can't spend it won't work anymore, And I can turn on extra usage and I gave it $100, but I have to be, I'm very careful about that because it burned through $82 in a day where this is a $200 a month subscription.

00:34:12 Dr. D
So I'm kind of learning also how to, how to operate with it. Right. And well, when that comes back, I'll show it. Oh, here we go. Okay.

00:34:33 Speaker 3
Dash.

00:34:50 Dr. D
Now, I don't, it's creating a, it's running, starting up a server in the background. I don't know how to do that myself, but it then created this dashboard. And this dashboard was just the things I thought it would be useful. So I have, these are my active students. These are the students who have inquired with me, whether I've got a picture of their panel or their insurance. And then these are my recurrent students and when I last flew with them.

00:35:28 Dr. D
This is a work in progress. And then these are my alumni students, the ones I'm not teaching right now, but people I have taught. And this is a surfacing of a database. That it built underneath the covers to store all my students. You could have something very similar for patients. Now, there are paid CRM systems that do all this. But I can just ask it to, I can just tell it, I'm, I'm meeting with Matt.

00:35:59 Dr. D
I'm going to, I'm going to go fly with Matt. Would you move him to move? I need to, I need to qualify him. I need a, I need his insurance. I need to, I need to get all the insurance stuff. And it knows there's a workflow for what I need for insurance because there's a bunch of back and forth with their insurance agent. So it can, it can track that whole workflow. And I just told it, this is what the workflow looks like. Like I literally just said, here's the sequence. And it then stored that away in its memory and says, okay, this is how, this is how this works.

00:36:32 Dr. D
So this is, this is the kind of thing that I'm kind of envisioning for you. Yeah, but it can all be managed. This could all be managed by OpenClaw. So the agent is out running all the time keeping this up to date. And then it can also interface to various messaging systems. So the one lots of people use for it that is very easy for it to interact with is Telegram. So it can send you a text saying, here are your follow-ups. Or you can send it a text saying, I got it. You can send it a text and have it keep notes for you.

00:37:14 Dr. D
So Telegram is one option. I'm not sure how much I really like Telegram. There's people also use Discord because it came with. With Discord, it can actually be vocal, verbal. I find texting to be not a great medium for me. So that's still how you interact with it, or you just do this on a desktop. You can also set this up, like when I was at your office, I was on my laptop.

00:37:47 Dr. D
I had told Claude before I left that I wanted to be able to work on my home machine remotely, and it created a secure VPN between us. Wow. And it uses a product called Tailscale or something, and it creates a very private network between the two sites.

00:38:18 Dr. D
Most of the time when you're working with Claude, you're actually working in a text window.

00:38:23 Speaker 3
Yeah.

00:38:24 Dr. D
And so that text window, I could create it when I was working with you. When I was there, like right now it says, Max Studio. I'm connected to my studio, but when I was on my laptop, I just did a one-line command, and now I'm talking to, now I'm talking to, I'm actually doing it on my, I'm actually working on my studio. The Macs are Unix machines, under the covers. This is Unix. And they were designed to be headless machines. They were designed so that you could reach out and just control another computer, and this is the ideal interface for them.

00:39:04 Dr. D
All the stuff you see on a Mac is just a shell that they run. It's a fancy front end for a Unix machine, which is why they're so secure and bulletproof, because Windows is not, was not designed this way. They didn't start with a secure underlying system. And so the, and you can do cloud on a Windows machine. I just wouldn't. You've got a studio sitting in your office, I'm assuming, kind of collecting dust.

00:39:36 Scott Hutchinson
Yeah, I just brought it home today. So I got a studio, and then I got a MacBook I bought for Christmas. Okay.

00:39:41 Dr. D
So the studio, this whole thing can run on the studio. That could be your primary dev environment. And the nice thing about OpenClaw is the studio, do you do anything with the studio? Does it have any of your records on it or anything? No.

---

## Part 2

00:00:04 Dr. D
It must have lost you. I think our time was up or something.

00:00:07 Scott Hutchinson
Yes, um, Zoom I think dropped. Are you there? Yeah, I'm here. Can you hear me? Yes, I can. Okay, So So, yeah. So does your studio do you do any have you used it for work at all at this point? Not much No no at all So that's perfect then, And when you bought it, do you know the specs on what you bought? Just ballpark. How much did it cost?

00:00:38 Dr. D
I think it was right around two grand. It's less than two grand. Okay. But I can send it to you. I can get the specs for you just ask it,

00:00:45 Scott Hutchinson
Right? That's, that's that's the ballpark That's the ballpark I need Studios come in 2 grand, 5 grand and 10 grand And. So that can actually do quite a bit locally. What you can do is you have that machine running wherever would be the best place for it to just live full time, where it's on all the time. Okay. And that could be at your office. That will basically run all of your stuff. And we can set up a VPN and I can help you, I can have my cloud actually control yours.

00:01:27 Scott Hutchinson
I can have my cloud control your computer and take and and get you get everything all set up. And then my cloud will create a will create a package for your cloud, so that your cloud doesn't have to recreate the wheel wheel. And then yeah, awesome. Yeah, And then then set it up so that your your Mac can remote into can remote into the machine when you are, you know, when you are elsewhere. And then your your MacBook um, You know, The idea is that you want to keep keep sensitive things off of it for at least for the time being. Um, And then um because there's a stack of things you're going to need to figure out like what uh what is a good um HIPAA drop uh file file transfer system. Um and Claude can help with that.

00:02:21 Scott Hutchinson
You just ask Claude, what's the best one that you can work with. And it'll go off and figure that out. And then it will store that in its memory of here's how we have patients send files in. So all that stuff, but first step though is get all the edits on the site. It had a, let's see what are the things that it wanted.

00:02:51 Scott Hutchinson
It wanted, um, so you have somebody named Doctor Young.

00:02:57 Dr. D
Yeah, Doctor Young. He's the pulmonologist that works. He's at the he works for the Air Force Two Air Medical Console Service. So um, so part of this we were going to be doing sports cardiology. Uhhuh. So I haven't started that part yet, but that's why I have that uh cardiopulmonary testing equipment. He knows how to run the CPETs. Uh, he can do. Uh pulmonary function tests by rometry all the lung stuff. Okay, um he's also an AME, but he. He's active duty military still, so he can only do it for the military. I see. But if he does it as an, he can still do it and then I would just be the one, it would go through me, right? I would just be doing all the A and E parts of that. So long story short, we want to get into the sports cardiology realm real soon. In fact, we're looking at bringing a sports cardiologist here and I'm actually meeting him tomorrow.

00:03:46 Dr. D
Okay, and so there's no sports cardiology place in this city. So I'm thinking about doing it. He's actually board certified in it, but that's again going to be down the road. But Doctor Young would be he can do the pulmonary stuff, he can do pulmonary consults. What he can't do is an official A and B exam.

00:04:03 Scott Hutchinson
I see. I would recommend my first thought would be to split the two and have two sites. Have a don't blend your air. You the aerospace cardiology with the with the sports. With the sports stuff. Okay. Just have a just have a second site. I mean, It's trivial once Claude knows how to build a site and has all your stuff, You can then just spec. You can just tell it all the things that you want it to look like and create another site, and it will just go off and do all the work for you. Okay. And it can have its own the mail server can have its own domain, it can have its own inbound email, All that they the two can be split, but it's easy, easy enough to manage because.

00:04:44 Scott Hutchinson
Because you're not managing it. Like, um, and then um, so it wants you to verify the buy loan credentials. It wants uh Doctor Young's credentials if we're going to include him in this. Um, and then all the service descriptions, All the stuff I was I sent you and all this, all the special issuance. Um, All the special issuance stuff that all just needs to be reviewed and whatever is the fastest easiest way for you to do it, if you want to just dictate it. That's that's fine. You can even send me a audio file and Claude will deal with it. Okay. Um, And thenum there's a there's a bunch of frequently asked questions on the site. Um, all those basically I don't trust any of this, right? Um It all needs to be reviewed. Yeah.

00:05:38 Dr. D
Um I'll review everything I can get back to you exactly Yeah, And so I can keep using this, the same site you sent me. Yeah,

00:05:47 Scott Hutchinson
Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah, you can do that and then more pictures would be helpful. Any sort of art would be great. Just if it doesn't have to be well sorted, Just if you hand me a stack of pictures of stuff that reflects the way you like. And if you like the coloring on the site or you want something different, any sort of style updates, Um, It just just describe describe what you'd like, and it will and it will do it. Um, and then um, And then the once we have the site laid out the way you want it. Um, we'll migrate. We'll we'll get you set up with an account on Netlify. Um, you can really do that anytime. It's N E T L I F Y dot com Okay And.

00:06:42 Scott Hutchinson
There's a and you can create a um create an account. And um you can you can start with just a a personal account. Um, it's um the the personal account is um I. The personal account is $ 9 a month. Okay, and once you once you create it, there's a there's a set of eight. There's some steps to give Claude the ability to work with it. Um, There's a the way these things work is they have something called an API key, and is this just big blob of text? And it basically gives them whatever access to the site you want. So in this case, like for Netlify, it's actually.

00:07:41 Scott Hutchinson
Claude is actually doing the uploads and configuration of it. Um, and so we we point once we have it up and running on Netlify, we point your we transition your site to point to Netlify instead of Wix. And bang, it's live. Um, We'd also put um like you can am I still sharing? Yeah. No, I don't think so did I Oh, I'm not Oh, I'm not sharing okay Here I am. I think I thought it was okay. Let me like here, look at this. Oh, you got to tell it to let me share again. Okay,

00:08:26 Speaker 3
Now share desktop. So.

00:08:38 Scott Hutchinson
This is my site. And one of the things So.

00:09:10 Scott Hutchinson
Not very exciting right now because there's not much out there. But um So this shows me where people are hitting my site. Um Whether they're new users or returning users, when you send it out, this is This is how many people have hit in the last month, how many have hit different pages and what they're hitting.

00:09:40 Scott Hutchinson
Um, your site when it goes live will have all of this. So you can see how how much is your? How much is how many people are actually hitting your site. Um,

00:09:52 Dr. D
Yeah, Wix does something like this too. I just don't ever look at it. Yeah,

00:09:57 Scott Hutchinson
Yeah, But I mean, and you can also create like a QR codeum for yourum when you give presentations, you can throw the QR code. People can take a shot do that.

00:10:06 Dr. D
I do that now. Yeah. Yeah, so I've noticed that when I go to these like I'll go, I gave a talk yeah a few weeks ago, and I got like four hundred hits. You know, so you see it you'll see it happen. Yeah. Yeah. And just got to make it user friendly. Yeah,

00:10:19 Scott Hutchinson
Yeah, I mean, and right now, the site doesn't the site doesn't, really, you know, i've had a lot of i'm like, i have this request a call thing, and that's and that's basically, i just ask, you know, and i get again, this turns into an email, right? I'm sure your site does the same thing. You get an email from it. Yeah.

00:10:38 Speaker 3
And you have a scheduling tool in yours. But I would hesitate unless you're sure you're actually going to. Yeah,

00:10:49 Dr. D
So they schedule and then I always. but it sends me an email, like I did, I think you too, I say okay and then we. and then I get back to you so.

00:10:59 Scott Hutchinson
Yeah, so what I would say is don't put a scheduler on it.

00:11:03 Dr. D
Yeah, that's what I yeah.

00:11:04 Scott Hutchinson
Yeah,'cause uh right now anyway.

00:11:07 Dr. D
Yeah. Um, and you'cause you also, you want to make sure you're filtering your filtering things out or or you you put a small window where you're just going to commit to having those times for those initial consults. Right. Um, which is fine too, then then it will, but you got to have something which then collects those. So you're ready for them. Um and all the more all the better to keep those 15 minute things.

00:11:33 Scott Hutchinson
Then when I have the actual get started, this actually goes through a much deeper page where it asks for things. These are all the things I need from someone. I need to know the name of the year of the airplane, the make model, the tail number, where it's going. And I need panels but nobody ever sends them to me right so, When I get a new student, I'll then tell after I've after I've talked to them. My method is to go do an initial consult with them, and then from there, I tell i tell my intention is to have tell Claude go off and go off and fetch the here's here's the follow up from our, you know, here's here's what happened on the on the call or I transcribe the call. And, then it it comes back with here are the follow ups from that call. And it drafts an email and I say yeah, go send that. And then.

00:12:26 Scott Hutchinson
You know, And then I have to hound them to send me the stuff that they need. So for me, I have to get um I do the initial thing, Find out what it is they're doing, and we talk about how much money it's going to cost them. That oftentimes filters out you know some of the people. And then I have to be on their insurance. And so then I need them to send connect me to their insurance agent. Their insurance agent is going want a bunch of stuff from me, and there's usually two or three emails back and forth with the insurance agent. But it cumulates with with a with a copy of the insurance, with my name on it. And now I'm happy to teach them. And an agreement with them that they're paying me in cash. Um, and they're they I've had people who didn't want to pay me in cash. They wanted the cash rate but they didn't want to pay me in cash. Um, And so I charge differently, if they if they want to send me a Zelle or.

00:13:24 Scott Hutchinson
Um, God forbid a credit card. I generally don't take credit cards anymore, but they want to pay me on something electronic. Um, the rate goes up thirty percent. That generally dissuades them from doing that. Um, Yeah and the for what it's worth. So.

00:13:45 Dr. D
All right. So my two dues are to just look through everything we've got right now on the website, give you anything that I think needs to be changed or. Modified and then number two, I'll get the specs on my studio, just so you know what I'm working with.

00:13:59 Scott Hutchinson
It's I'm sure it's fine. Even the cheapest studio would be fine.

00:14:03 Dr. D
And then uh and then the Netlify, should I go ahead and get that account or just wait for that?

00:14:08 Scott Hutchinson
Yeah, you could go ahead and get Netlify. Andum while we're at it, there's uh this man You want to set up an account on Fastmail? Fastmail. Yeah.

00:14:34 Speaker 3
Oh, come on. So.

00:14:42 Scott Hutchinson
It's just like any other email server, but it has you can have multiple domains and on Fastmail. Um, The billing and plan you want is. I did the family plan. For a year, it's one hundred and forty dollars. Okay. And that allows you to have multiple users and multiple domains. Um, in the case of like your domain, you can have you can have multiple inbound like you can have info, you can have eddie, you can have.

00:15:19 Scott Hutchinson
You can have multiple inbound emails that all go into the same mailbox. But should you do a different domain, you can also have that on here as well. So like right now, I have dual given, which is I'm building an app and it needs, and it has its own website and. I also told the AI system to find a business that could make money. And so it thinks it thinks scheduling and management of a, I'm trying to build I'm trying to I'm giving it a chance to build an AI business. So anyway, I have three domains going into this thing and, I can have up to five and I can control, which which ones have which mailboxes. And that all fits in the cheap family plan. Which is like $12 a month $13 a month.

00:16:16 Dr. D
And while I make that, so right you have yeah Scott at the you know the TXCFI. Yeah. So it'll be at Mach one or something like that? Yeah, yeah. Okay.

00:16:26 Scott Hutchinson
Yeah, soum whatever your what's your existing site right now?

00:16:33 Dr. D
Uh what's the uh what's the address?

00:16:36 Scott Hutchinson
Yeah, so yeah your your domain is aerospace cardiology?

00:16:40 Dr. D
Yeah aerospacecardiology dot com I think is what it is. Aerospace medical. Let me see. Let me see what it is. No, that's not it. Ethical aerospace cardiology, is what it is. I can throw in the chat if you want.

00:16:59 Scott Hutchinson
Yeah, this one. Yeah, so that's a mouthful. Um,

00:17:07 Dr. D
I can just have it mock 1. Com we could we could make that better I don't know, but yeah,

00:17:11 Speaker 3
You're fine. Shorter. He's here to remember website name. Make it work this. Check for availability, thinking of me in our top ten.

00:17:48 Scott Hutchinson
So that's this interaction. You can see how I'm talking to it. Yeah. It's now going off and it's doing a bunch of work off in the- - And. It's off running. And it might take a couple of minutes.

00:18:20 Dr. D
Yeah, because I mean that's the domain I you know paid for or whatever. Butum yeah,

00:18:24 Scott Hutchinson
They're they're cheap though. Um yeah,

00:18:26 Dr. D
Domains are usually pretty.

00:18:28 Scott Hutchinson
Yeah, I mean as long as it's one that hasn't been captured yet, you can get them for as little as ten bucks ten twelve bucks a year. Um You do them did you do it through Wix?

00:18:38 Dr. D
I did do it through Wix yeah.

00:18:40 Scott Hutchinson
Through Wix yeah So there's uh there's domain servers out there. There's domain hosting places out there that that do this stuff really cheap. Um. I do it all through Square, but it was only because I did my domains withum with Google originally. Um both Mach One Cardiology and Flying Heart Doc appear available. Uh be sure to.

00:19:06 Speaker 3
Check this. And.

00:19:15 Scott Hutchinson
I don't know where it does all this befuddling thing.

00:19:41 Scott Hutchinson
Because this sort of stuff takes hours, right, to try and find a site. Aviation and cardiology is taken. Nobody ever lets them expire anymore. That's a myth. I um I got my Hutchinson dot org because Congressman Hutchinson didn't pay his bill like twenty years ago. In those days, you didn't pay the bill the next day; it was available, and I grabbed it. That's sad. Yeah, My brother actually ran into him at an air show and was laughing about it with him. So while that works, um. yeah, yeah so so yeah so.

00:20:37 Scott Hutchinson
Well, all those sorts of things can be sorted out. So these uh here are here's everything that's available. Fly mock one med. Flying heart doc, not bad. Mock one cardiology. Cleared to fly, that's a nice one.

00:21:09 Scott Hutchinson
So, think about those. Put.

00:21:21 Speaker 3
That and the checklist onto Add Netlify account as admin.

00:21:40 Speaker 3
And surface. And page. Title sample. Site title. Yes, menu look optional. So I'm going to go ahead and do this. So it doesn't also give a list of commands to fix the head.

00:22:43 Scott Hutchinson
Okay, So it's going to go off and that should actually just show up on the site. And then it'll it'll show up there, so you so it's all in one place.

00:22:59 Dr. D
Sounds good. So now I have a list of stuff to do.

00:23:03 Scott Hutchinson
Yeah, yeah. They were quite excited about it. Um, I would I think I think you've got enough. You know what what I would do isum. And this stuff, what you're doing is it's a black hole for most for most pilots. Um, the you could do a um, you know get on the YouTube channels. Um, it's it's too late to get to the big air show in April to get a slot there. It's not too late to do to go to Oshkosh and give a talk.

00:23:42 Scott Hutchinson
Um, all depends on if you are into air shows. They don't pay anything, they don't cover your expenses or anything. But yeah, um,

00:23:48 Dr. D
It'd be worth it for the.

00:23:50 Scott Hutchinson
Huge exposure. Yeah,

00:23:52 Dr. D
From the exposure probably.

00:23:53 Scott Hutchinson
Yeah, I mean t here is a and t here is a I gotta admit I've always kind of wanted to go. So oh, it's an absolute blast and.

00:24:02 Dr. D
Never I've never been I've only heard just amazing stories.

00:24:04 Scott Hutchinson
Yeah, It's, it's massive. I mean, It runs for a week week. We've got a group that go up there. Um we go up. For two or three days of it, and we go to Sun and Fun in Lakeland. That's the second week of April. And if you're interested, you are welcome. We've got a big group house we do. And we fly into Kissimmee, but you could easily fly into Orlando and Uber over to us. We rent this nine bedroom house.

00:24:42 Scott Hutchinson
And get a couple of cars and we just go. And it's just it's just a bunch of pilots. We all go to the air show. And go to the air show for one or two days and then fly home. And there is a, and we've got a, it's like a guy thing, you know, it's a guy trip. But not exactly a rosh group. But you are more than welcome if you want to come. There's a, I play the bank. I just tell people, it's a to it's it's a five hundred dollars deposit, and it works out to be usually by the time we're all done, I end up refunding money. Um, but that covers the hotel and or the house and the rental cars and the and we'd go to the store and buy way too much food and some booze and beer and stuff. And uh go to the drive over to the show, um go to the show for for day.

00:25:40 Scott Hutchinson
Usually a couple of days, and then by then people are kind of burnt out. But it'd be a pretty good view of It's like a mini Oshkosh. But it's the most accessible. Oshkosh is fantastic, but it's a little difficult to go to. The challenge with Oshkosh is one getting there, And then the other challenge with Oshkosh is A. Lot of people will fly into like Milwaukee or Green Bay. Um, well, you are right next to Cincinnati, so you've got nonstops everywhere. So, you can if you can get a flight into Appleton is great. But then it's where do you stay and rental cars? So rental cars and where to stay at Oshkosh is the big nightmare. Uh. So we do an Airbnb there. I've had the same family I've rented from the same family now for like ten years um and.

00:26:38 Scott Hutchinson
It's a smaller group of the people who go to Sun and Fun. Sun and Fun, I get such a big house. I can't guarantee you don't have a roommate, but we end up with between eight and twelve people in a nine-bedroom house. And that we always have room in; I always have room. But at Oshkosh, I had people wanting to; last year I had. I had someone wanted to camp in the backyard,

00:27:10 Scott Hutchinson
And I was like," Why would you do that? The bugs up there are terrible at night." Yeah,

00:27:15 Dr. D
Florida is not.

00:27:16 Scott Hutchinson
Oh well, this was at Oshkosh. So Oshkosh. So yeah, but it's just as bad. I mean, it's it'sum it's just as bad and they ended up. It was actually the otherum the other lady, who was with that did with Jamie and Pat, uh was her and her son camped in the backyard. And. They ended up just sleeping on the floor in the house. Um, and but yeah. Okay, so it should say it should.

00:27:46 Dr. D
Yeah, I see it. It says Eddie review.

00:27:48 Scott Hutchinson
Uhhuh. Isn't that cool? It's so much faster. Where is it? Where did they put it? Where did they put Eddie? No,

00:27:55 Dr. D
I didn't put it on the one you made me The file one Oh I.

00:27:59 Scott Hutchinson
Oh, yeah, the other one.

00:28:15 Scott Hutchinson
Oh yeah, cool. That's still that still wigs me out when it just does that. Yeah,

00:28:23 Dr. D
Sweet, great. I will look over that, and then I will get back to you as soon as I can.

00:28:28 Scott Hutchinson
Yep, It'sum we can get you've seen how long it takes to do this once. And this stuff that I am doing. It's just a matter ofum one. The next time we get together, let's also have your studio set up someplace. Probably best that you're in front of it. So I can get enough control of it to, then walk you through everything. It's also going to need to be locked down. So everything that you're doing has to be secured. And this can secure it. So. Alrighty. Cool, very good sir.

00:29:12 Dr. D
Sounds great. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.

00:29:15 Scott Hutchinson
No problem, no problem.

00:29:16 Dr. D
I'm excited, I'm excited to see if this all works out.

00:29:19 Scott Hutchinson
Yeah, no, Yeah awesome Cool All right Have, a nice Have, a good evening See ya.
