# FAA Special Issuance — Cardiac Conditions Requirements

## Overview

Special Issuance (SI) authorization allows pilots with otherwise disqualifying medical conditions to hold FAA medical certificates. All three classes (1st, 2nd, 3rd) are eligible. The process requires specific documentation, testing within defined timeframes, and ongoing monitoring.

**Legal basis:** 14 CFR § 67.401

---

## Cardiac Conditions Requiring Special Issuance

### 1. Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)

**Conditions covered:** Myocardial infarction, CABG, coronary stenting/angioplasty, angina, coronary artery disease >50% stenosis

**Recovery periods:**
- 1st/2nd class: 6 months (CABG), 3 months (stent)
- 3rd class: No mandatory recovery period (per Public Law 114-190)

**Required documentation:**
- Hospital admission H&P, operative report, discharge summary
- For stents: make, model, serial number, implant location, length & diameter
- Complete ECG treadmill tracings
- 6-month post-event coronary angiogram (1st class and unlimited 2nd class)
- Nuclear exercise treadmill stress test
- All diagnostic test results

---

### 2. Cardiac Valve Replacement/Repair

**Recovery periods:**
- 1st/2nd class: 6 months (replacement), 90 days (repair)
- 3rd class: No required wait time (BasicMed)

**Required documentation:**
- Current treating physician report (cardiovascular condition, symptoms, recovery)
- 24-hour Holter monitor (within 90 days) with representative tracings
- M-mode, 2-dimensional echocardiogram with Doppler (within 90 days)
- If on Coumadin: stability confirmation, dosing history, monthly INR values for past 6 months
- Must show: no embolic phenomena, no significant arrhythmia, no structural abnormality, no ischemic disease

**AASI notes:**
- AME must defer if new onset arrhythmia
- AME must defer if >20% of INR values <2.5 or >3.5

---

### 3. Atrial Fibrillation / Atrial Flutter

**Required documentation (within 90 days):**
- Minimum 24-hour cardiac monitor
- Completed Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation/A-Flutter Status Summary
- Cardiologist evaluation addressing all items on status report

**Certification requirements:**
- No evidence/suspicion of stroke, TIA, or thromboembolic event
- Heart rate well controlled per cardiologist interpretation
- If CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥2: emboli mitigation verified without side effects

---

### 4. Cardiac Pacemakers

**Recovery period:** 2 months observation

**Requirements:**
- No evidence of coronary artery disease
- No need for heart valve replacement
- Periodic follow-up reports required

---

### 5. Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators (ICD/AICD)

**Current policy:** Generally NOT permitted for any class

**Exception requirements:**
- Device must not have "fired" for at least 2 years
- Device must be deactivated or explanted
- Policy may be evolving (FAA recently granted first-ever 1st class with active ICD)

---

### 6. Ventricular Arrhythmias

**May be granted SI if not associated with:**
- Underlying ischemic heart disease
- Cardiomyopathy
- Significant heart valve defect

**Requirements:** Good medical management, documentation of stability

---

### 7. Aortic Aneurysm

**Disqualifying threshold:** Untreated aneurysm >4.5 cm

**Recovery period:** 3 months (ATCS), 6 months (airmen)

**Required documentation:**
- Hospital records (admission H&P, operative report, discharge summary)
- Detailed cardiovascular evaluation showing functional recovery and prognosis

---

### 8. Congenital Heart Disease

**General approach:** Case-by-case evaluation based on:
- Current evidence
- Surgical options and outcomes
- Post-operative follow-up
- Licensing restrictions likely

## Testing Requirements & Timing

| Test | Timing Requirement | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| ECG | Within 60 days | Required for 1st class after age 35, annually after 40 |
| Stress Test | Within 60-90 days | Bruce protocol, nuclear, stress echo, or pharmaceutical |
| Echocardiogram | Within 90 days | M-mode, 2D with Doppler |
| Holter Monitor | Within 90 days | Minimum 24-hour, with representative tracings |
| Coronary Angiogram | 6 months post-event | Report AND actual images on CD |
| Cardiovascular Evaluation | Within 90 days | Full H&P, meds, functional capacity, risk factors, prognosis |

---

## Special Issuance Process Flow

### First-Time Application
1. **MedXPress:** Pilot discloses disqualifying cardiac condition
2. **AME Exam:** AME examines, cannot issue — defers to FAA
3. **Documentation Gathering:** Pilot collects all required records, tests, physician reports
4. **FAA Submission:** Complete package sent to Aerospace Medical Certification Division (AMCD)
5. **FAA Review:** FAA physician reviews case (typically 60-90 days)
6. **Decision:** Authorization for Special Issuance or denial

### AASI (AME Assisted Special Issuance) — Renewals
- Available after initial FAA authorization for certain conditions
- Pilot returns to AME with updated documentation per protocol
- **AME can issue certificate directly** — no FAA review needed
- Authorization valid 5 years; certificate typically valid 12 months
- Much faster: same-day vs. months

### Ongoing Monitoring
- Certificate duration: typically 12 months
- Annual follow-up testing required per condition protocol
- Submit updated testing before expiration
- FAA can withdraw authorization anytime for adverse change

---

## Authorization Types

| Type | For | Duration | Renewal |
|------|-----|----------|---------|
| **Special Issuance (SI)** | Progressive/changing conditions | Time-limited (12 mo typical) | Must repeatedly demonstrate fitness |
| **SODA** | Static, nonprogressive conditions | Permanent | Not required |

Most cardiac conditions use SI (not SODA) since cardiac conditions are progressive/changing.

---

## Medical Certificate Classes

| Class | Who | Renewal |
|-------|-----|---------|
| 1st | Airline transport pilots | Every 12 mo (<40) or 6 mo (40+) |
| 2nd | Commercial pilots | Every 12 months |
| 3rd | Private/recreational pilots | Every 60 mo (<40) or 24 mo (40+) |

**BasicMed:** May be an option for 3rd class pilots after one-time special issuance for certain cardiac conditions.

## Hypertension — No Special Issuance Needed

Handled under CACI (Conditions AMEs Can Issue):
- BP must be ≤155/95 in AME's office
- Up to 3 approved medications from FAA list
- 7-day ground trial when starting/adjusting medication
