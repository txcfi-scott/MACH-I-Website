## 1. Overview of Certification Pathways

The FAA uses three distinct pathways for pilots with cardiovascular conditions:

### Special Issuance (SI) — 14 CFR 67.401
- For **disqualifying** conditions (MI, CABG, valve replacement, etc.)
- Initial authorization: **Only** the Federal Air Surgeon / AMCD can grant
- Subsequent renewals may use AASI (see below)
- Time-limited, typically 12 months; authorization valid up to 5 years

### AASI — AME Assisted Special Issuance
- For **renewal** of an existing Special Issuance authorization
- AME can re-issue certificate directly in the office — no FAA review
- Requires pilot to present: (1) valid authorization letter, (2) all required current documentation per condition-specific protocol
- Available for: CHD, AFib/Flutter, Valve Replacement/Repair, Aortic Insufficiency, PAT/SVT, VTE, Mitral Valve Disease

### CACI — Conditions AMEs Can Issue
- For conditions that are **manageable** and well-defined
- AME can issue without FAA involvement if worksheet criteria are met
- Cardiovascular CACI conditions: **Hypertension**, **Mitral Valve Repair** (5+ years post-op), **Carotid/Vertebral Artery Stenosis** (50-79%), **certain arrhythmias** (isolated PACs, etc.)
- Worksheets do NOT need to be submitted to FAA — retained in AME's files

## 9. Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators (ICD)

### Current FAA Policy
**Active ICDs are generally DISQUALIFYING for all classes.**

### Historic Exception (2025)
In April 2025, the FAA granted the first-ever first-class medical certificate to a pilot with an **active** ICD. This represents a potential policy shift, but as of this writing, it remains an exceptional case rather than standard practice.

### Pathway if ICD is Deactivated
If a pilot has a combined pacemaker/ICD device:
- ICD circuit must be turned **OFF** (deactivated)
- Documented by treating cardiologist in writing
- Statement required: whether ICD function is needed or not
- Then follows the **Pacemaker protocol** (see Section 8)
- Cardiac narrative must describe:
  - Reason for pacemaker and ICD implantation
  - Assessment regarding whether ICD is needed
  - General physical and cardiac examination
  - Symptoms or treatment referable to cardiovascular system
  - Interim and current cardiac condition
  - Functional capacity
  - Complete medical history

### Pathway if ICD is Explanted
- After ICD removal, follows standard pathway for underlying condition
- Requires documentation of explantation and post-explant cardiac workup

**[FLAG: This area is actively evolving. The 2025 active ICD approval may signal new policy. Monitor FAA guidance updates closely.]**

## 12. Arrhythmias (General)

The FAA has specific disposition pathways for many arrhythmia types. Here is the complete list:

### AME Can Issue (with documentation)

| Arrhythmia | Requirements | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| Premature Atrial Contractions (2+ on ECG) | Evaluate for MVP, caffeine, pulmonary disease, thyroid | Issue if no structural disease |
| Premature Ventricular Contractions (2+ on ECG) | Maximal GXT with baseline ECG | Issue if PVCs resolve during exercise and no structural disease |
| 1st Degree AV Block (PR <300 ms) | Asymptomatic | Issue; annotate Item 60 |
| 2nd Degree AV Block — Mobitz I | CVE Protocol | Issue if no structural disease |
| Bradycardia (<50 bpm) | CVE Protocol plus additional tests | Issue if no structural/functional/coronary disease |

### Requires FAA Decision

| Arrhythmia | Requirements | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| 1st Degree AV Block (PR >= 300 ms) | Holter + cardiac evaluation | Defer to FAA |
| 2nd Degree AV Block — Mobitz II | CVE + 24-hour Holter | All cases require FAA decision |
| 3rd Degree (Complete) AV Block | CVE + 24-hour Holter | All cases require FAA decision |

| Supraventricular Tachycardia | CVE + echo + 24-hour Holter | Initial: FAA decision; follow-up per AASI |
| Implanted Pacemaker | Per Pacemaker Disposition Table | All cases require FAA decision |
| Bundle Branch Block | Per BBB Protocol (see below) | Depends on type and age |

### Radiofrequency Ablation (any arrhythmia)
- 3-month waiting period post-procedure
- 24-hour Holter monitoring required
- If Holter negative and no recurrence: AME may issue
- If any issues: FAA decision required

### Bundle Branch Block Protocol

**Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB):**

## 16. Graded Exercise Stress Test (Bruce Protocol)

This is the most commonly required cardiac test for aviation medical certification. The FAA has very specific requirements.

### Bruce Protocol Stages

| Stage | Duration | Speed | Grade | Cumulative Time |
|-------|----------|-------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | 3 min | 1.7 mph | 10% | 3 min |
| 2 | 3 min | 2.5 mph | 12% | 6 min |
| 3 | 3 min | 3.4 mph | 14% | 9 min |
| 4 | 3 min | 4.2 mph | 16% | 12 min |
| 5 | 3 min | 5.0 mph | 18% | 15 min |

### FAA Passing Criteria

**Minimum duration:** 9 minutes (completion of Stage 3)
- Exception: 6 minutes for applicants age 70+

**Heart rate target:** 100% of predicted maximal heart rate (PMHR)
- PMHR = 220 minus age
- Studies achieving < 85% PMHR AND < 9 minutes: may serve as basis for DENIAL
- Between 85-100% PMHR: may be acceptable if all other criteria met

**ST segment criteria:**
- ST depression of 1mm or greater during stress = ABNORMAL
- Unless supplemental imaging (nuclear or echocardiography) demonstrates absence of reversible ischemia

### Medication Considerations
The following should be discontinued 24-48 hours before testing (when feasible and with treating physician consent):
- Beta blockers
- Calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil)
- Digitalis preparations

If medications cannot be held: applicant must provide explanation from treating cardiologist documenting why discontinuation was contraindicated.

### Documentation Requirements — EXACT Specifications

**Must submit ALL of the following:**
1. Worksheet with blood pressure and pulse recordings at each exercise stage
2. Interpretive report
3. Actual ECG tracings (NOT computer-generated samples):
   - Full 12-lead ECG at rest — supine AND standing
   - Tracings at EACH stage of exercise
   - Tracings at peak exercise
   - Recovery tracings (minimum 5 minutes of recovery)
4. Standard tracings only — computer-generated samples are UNACCEPTABLE

### Special Populations
Patients with any of the following require **stress echocardiography or nuclear imaging** instead of plain GXT:
- Bundle branch blocks
- Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)
- Baseline ST/T wave abnormalities

---

## 17. Cardiovascular Evaluation (CVE) Protocol

The CVE is the standard cardiac workup referenced throughout the AME Guide. The full protocol is available at: [CVE Protocol PDF](https://www.faa.gov/ame_guide/media/Cardiovascular_Evaluation_Protocol.pdf)

### Required Components

**1. Medical History**
- Particular reference to cardiovascular abnormalities (cerebral, visceral, peripheral)
- Current and recent medications: type, purpose, dosage, duration

**2. Family, Personal, and Social History**
- Ages and health status of parents and siblings (if deceased: age at death, cause)
- Family history of: heart attacks, hypertension, diabetes, lipid disorders
- Applicant's: smoking status, alcohol use, physical fitness habits, functional limitations

**3. Previous Medical Records**
- Hospital records, outpatient treatment records
- Clinical data, X-ray and laboratory observations
- Originals or good copies of ALL ECG tracings
- Detailed reports of surgical procedures, cardiac imaging, diagnostic evaluations

**4. Physical Examination**
- Height, weight
- Bilateral blood pressure readings
- Retinal examination
- Peripheral artery condition
- Carotid artery assessment
- Heart: size, rate, rhythm
- Murmur characteristics: location, intensity, timing
- Other significant findings

**5. Laboratory Requirements (minimum)**
- Serum cholesterol and triglycerides (after 12-16 hour fasting)
- Fasting blood glucose
- Hemoglobin A1C (may be required if glucose elevated)

**Preferred provider:** Specialist in internal medicine or cardiology

---

## 18. CAC Scoring and CCTA

### Recent Addition
As of January 28, 2026, the FAA added a formal protocol for Cardiac Testing for Coronary Artery Calcification (CAC) Scoring, Calcium Score, and Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA).

Protocol document: [Cardiac Testing Protocol PDF](https://www.faa.gov/ame_guide/media/Cardiac_Testing_Protocol.pdf)

### Key Thresholds (from published FAA guidance)
For asymptomatic pilots with >10% 10-year cardiovascular risk:
- **CAC score > 100:** Mandated to undergo functional imaging and invasive coronary angiography; grounded until further risk assessment
- **Left main stenosis > 30% on CCTA:** Same requirement
- **Any stenosis > 50% on CCTA:** Same requirement

### Carotid/Vertebral Artery Stenosis
- **50-79% stenosis:** CACI pathway available
- **>= 80% or symptomatic:** Deferral required

**[FLAG: The Cardiac Testing Protocol PDF could not be text-extracted during this research. The thresholds above come from secondary sources. Recommend obtaining and reviewing the actual protocol document for exact specifications.]**

---

## 19. The Special Issuance Process

### Who Can Grant Initial Authorization
**ONLY the Federal Air Surgeon / AMCD (Aerospace Medical Certification Division) in Oklahoma City** can grant initial Special Issuance authorization. AMEs cannot.

### Process Steps

**Step 1: MedXPress (FAA Form 8500-8)**
- Pilot discloses disqualifying cardiac condition via MedXPress online system
- Item 18.g specifically asks about "Heart or vascular trouble"

**Step 2: AME Examination**
- AME performs exam, reviews documentation
- AME CANNOT issue certificate — must defer to FAA
- AME forwards application and all documentation to AMCD

**Step 3: Documentation Assembly**
- Pilot collects all required records per condition-specific protocol
- Better to submit complete package upfront than wait for FAA requests

**Step 4: FAA Submission**
- Complete package sent to AMCD in Oklahoma City
- Two addresses depending on mail type (USPS vs. courier)
- Can also submit via fax (for packages under 10 pages, with advance notification)

**Step 5: FAA Review**
- FAA physician reviews case
- May request additional information (adds months to timeline)
- Cardiovascular cases may be reviewed by FAA Cardiology Panel
- Multiple rounds of information requests are common for complex cases

**Step 6: Decision**
- Authorization for Special Issuance granted, OR
- Denial issued (with appeal rights)

### Processing Timelines (realistic estimates)

| Scenario | Typical Timeline |
|----------|-----------------|
| Complete, straightforward initial application | 2-3 months |
| Initial application with information requests | 3-6 months |
| Complex or unusual cases | 6-12+ months |
| AASI renewal (AME re-issues in office) | Same day |
| Each FAA information request response cycle | ~2 weeks per round |

**Critical insight:** The single biggest factor in timeline is completeness of initial submission. Incomplete packages trigger information request cycles, each adding weeks or months.

### What Happens During Review
1. Application arrives at AMCD Oklahoma City
2. Assigned to an FAA physician reviewer
3. Reviewer checks against condition-specific protocol requirements
4. If complete: decision made
5. If incomplete: letter sent requesting specific additional information
6. For complex cardiac cases: may go to FAA Cardiology Panel
7. Decision letter mailed to pilot

### Initial SI vs. Renewal
| Aspect | Initial SI | AASI Renewal |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| Who decides | Federal Air Surgeon / AMCD | AME (in office) |
| Timeline | Weeks to months | Same day |
| Documentation | Full workup per protocol | Status summary + required tests |
| Where to submit | Oklahoma City | AME's office |
| Cost | Exam + testing + time | Exam + testing |

### Certificate and Authorization Duration
- Medical certificate: typically valid 12 months
- Authorization: valid up to **5 years**
- Certificate cannot extend beyond authorization expiration
- At 5-year mark: FAA determines whether to renew or discontinue authorization
- As of May 2023: FAA no longer routinely sends "Continue Authorization" letters when AMEs issue correctly

---

## 20. AASI Process

### How AASI Works

AASI (AME Assisted Special Issuance) allows AMEs to **re-issue** (not initially grant) airman medical certificates for conditions that already have FAA authorization.

**Requirements for AME to use AASI:**
1. Pilot presents valid FAA Authorization letter
2. Pilot provides all documentation specified in the condition-specific AASI page
3. ALL items on the applicable Status Summary form are satisfactory
4. No deferral criteria are triggered

**What AME does:**
- Reviews documentation against AASI requirements
- If all criteria met: issues medical certificate
- If any criteria not met: MUST defer to AMCD

### Conditions with AASI Pathways (Cardiovascular)

**All Classes:**
- Atrial Fibrillation / Flutter
- Aortic Insufficiency
- Mitral Valve Disease
- Paroxysmal Atrial Tachycardia
- Venous Thromboembolism

**Third Class (also available for other classes with prior authorization):**
- Coronary Heart Disease
- Single Valve Replacement or Repair

---

## 21. CACI Process

### How CACI Works

CACI (Conditions AMEs Can Issue) is for well-defined conditions in mild/stable forms that require minimal documentation.

**Key characteristics:**
- AME can issue standard-duration medical certificate
- No FAA contact required
- Worksheets provide specific criteria the AME checks
- Worksheets retained in AME's files — NOT submitted to FAA
- AME should review Disposition Table BEFORE the CACI worksheet to verify CACI applies

### Cardiovascular CACI Conditions
1. **Hypertension** — up to 3 acceptable medications, BP <= 155/95
2. **Mitral Valve Repair** — 5+ years post-op, no co-morbidities
3. **Carotid/Vertebral Artery Stenosis** — 50-79% stenosis
4. **Certain isolated arrhythmias** — PACs, 1st degree AV block (PR <300ms), Mobitz I (if no structural disease), bradycardia (if no structural disease), PVCs (if resolve with exercise)

---

## 22. BasicMed and Cardiac Conditions

### BasicMed Overview
BasicMed (Public Law 114-190, effective May 2017; modified by FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024) allows pilots to fly without holding a current FAA medical certificate under certain conditions.

### Cardiac Conditions and BasicMed

**One-time Special Issuance REQUIRED before using BasicMed for:**
- Myocardial infarction
- Coronary heart disease that has required treatment
- Cardiac valve replacement
- Heart replacement

**Critical rule:** If you have been diagnosed with any of these conditions and have **never** had an FAA Special Issuance authorization for that condition, you **cannot** fly under BasicMed until you obtain one.

**If you HAVE held an SI:** If you have held a Special Issuance medical certificate **at any time on or after July 15, 2006** and your medical status is unchanged, you should be able to fly under BasicMed (provided you meet all other BasicMed qualifications and are under physician care for the condition).

### BasicMed Limitations
- Restricted to operations that would otherwise require only a 3rd class medical
- Aircraft: 6 or fewer seats, not exceeding 6,000 lbs
- Altitude: below 18,000 feet MSL
- Speed: not exceeding 250 knots
- Must complete online medical education course every 24 months
- Must have physical exam with state-licensed physician every 48 months using FAA Form 8700-2
- Physician does NOT need to be an AME

### What BasicMed Does NOT Require
- No FAA-style stress testing
- No periodic cardiac imaging
- No submission of records to FAA
- No waiting for FAA review

**Strategic consideration:** Some pilots with cardiac conditions who only need 3rd class privileges choose to obtain one initial SI and then transition to BasicMed to avoid the ongoing AASI paperwork and testing burden.

## 23. Common Mistakes and Deferral Causes

### Documentation Mistakes
1. **Incomplete hospital records** — Missing operative reports, discharge summaries, or diagnostic test results is the #1 cause of delays
2. **Missing ECG tracings** — Must be originals or legible copies; faxed or photocopied ECGs from stress tests are often rejected
3. **Computer-generated stress test summaries** — FAA requires actual ECG tracings at each stage, not just the computer summary
4. **Expired testing** — Documentation more than 90 days old at time of AME exam
5. **Missing device specifications** — For stents: make, model, serial number, length, diameter, implant location. For pacemakers: generator AND lead specifications
6. **Missing line drawings** — Coronary angiograms for 1st/2nd class must include line drawings of coronary anatomy, not just the report
7. **INR records gaps** — Must be monthly and continuous; gaps trigger deferral
8. **Unsigned or undated forms** — Status Summaries must be signed and dated by treating physician

### Process Mistakes
9. **Testing before recovery period ends** — Post-event testing obtained too early is not accepted
10. **Assuming AME can handle initial SI** — AMEs cannot grant initial authorization; only AMCD can
11. **Providing unsolicited extra information** — Providing more than what's requested can introduce new issues that trigger additional review
12. **Relying on physician's office to mail records** — Records often get lost or delayed; pilot should assemble and submit personally
13. **Not keeping copies** — Records can be lost at FAA; always retain complete copies
14. **Calling FAA on Monday/Tuesday** — Highest call volume days; Wednesday-Friday are better for status inquiries
15. **Not using condition-specific Status Summary forms** — These forms streamline FAA review; submitting a free-form narrative instead causes delays

### Medical Mistakes
16. **Stress test on beta blockers** — Beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digitalis should be held 24-48 hours (with physician approval); not holding them makes the test potentially non-diagnostic
17. **Inadequate stress test duration** — Less than 9 minutes (6 for age 70+) or less than 85% PMHR may not be acceptable
18. **Not addressing CHA2DS2-VASc score** — For AFib patients, if score >= 2 and no emboli mitigation is documented, automatic deferral
19. **Outdated records becoming stale during review** — If initial submission takes months and FAA requests additional information, original records may exceed 90-day window; need fresh documentation

---

## 24. Tips for Clean Submission

### Pre-Application Preparation
1. **Review the exact FAA protocol** for your condition BEFORE getting any testing done — ensure your cardiologist knows the FAA's specific requirements (Bruce protocol, not just any stress test)
2. **Use an aviation-knowledgeable cardiologist** or at minimum, provide your cardiologist with the FAA protocol documents
3. **Consider consultation with an aviation medical specialist** before applying (e.g., Dr. Eddie Davenport at Medical Aerospace Cardiology & Human Performance Institute, or Pilot Medical Solutions/LeftSeat.com at 888-LEFTSEAT)
4. **Time your testing carefully** — all documentation should be as close to 90-day freshness as possible at the time of AME exam

### Documentation Assembly
5. **Use the FAA's Status Summary forms** — they are designed to match what reviewers look for
6. **Organize chronologically** — oldest records on top
7. **Remove duplicates** and illegible pages
8. **Ensure every page** has applicant's full name, date of birth, and FAA PI# (if known)
9. **Include complete hospital records** — H&P, operative report, discharge summary, all test results, all ECG tracings
10. **Submit complete ECG tracings** — actual tracings at each stress test stage, not just the computer-generated summary page

### AME Selection
11. **Choose an AME who will be your advocate** — an experienced AME familiar with cardiac SI cases can catch issues before submission
12. **Some AMEs specialize in complex cases** — aviation cardiologists like Dr. Davenport function as both AME and cardiovascular consultant

### Submission Strategy
13. **Submit the most complete package possible** on first attempt — every information request cycle adds weeks-months
14. **Use trackable shipping** (FedEx, UPS) rather than USPS for submissions to Oklahoma City
15. **Retain complete copies** of everything submitted
16. **For AASI renewals** — bring all documentation to AME appointment; AME can issue same day if everything is in order

### Follow-Up
17. **Allow 15+ business days** before requesting status inquiry
18. **Use AOPA Pilot Protection Services** or similar advocacy services for tracking
19. **If records become stale during review** — proactively update with fresh documentation rather than waiting for FAA to request it

---
