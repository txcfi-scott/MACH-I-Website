## Critical HIPAA Compliance Checklist

Before choosing any service, ensure:

1. **Business Associate Agreement (BAA):** Signed agreement between your practice and the vendor. Non-negotiable for HIPAA compliance.
2. **Encryption in Transit:** TLS/SSL (typically 128-bit or higher)
3. **Encryption at Rest:** AES-256 or equivalent
4. **Access Controls:** Role-based permissions, MFA option
5. **Audit Logging:** Complete logs of who accessed what, when
6. **Data Location:** Confirm servers are in your region (US or specified)
7. **Breach Notification:** Vendor should have documented breach response procedures
8. **Subcontractor Liability:** If vendor uses subcontractors, they must also sign BAAs

**Fines for Non-Compliance:**
- Up to $1.5M per violation category per year
- Non-compliance can affect licensing and reputation

---

## Implementation Roadmap for Small Practice

### Phase 1: Quick Start (Month 1)
1. Choose a service based on your primary use case (uploads vs. imaging vs. intake forms)
2. Request BAA and review terms (should be standard for HIPAA-compliant vendors)
3. Set up account and test with a dummy patient record
4. Train staff on sending patient upload links or embedding form

### Phase 2: Integration (Month 2)
1. If using Innoport or FormDoctor: embed upload widget/form on website
2. If using Patient Gain or others: create email template with upload link
3. Document your process: when/how patients receive upload instructions

### Phase 3: Workflow Optimization (Month 3+)
1. Monitor file uploads and staff feedback
2. Adjust form fields or upload instructions based on what works
3. Consider integration with EHR if available
4. Set up backup/archival process for received files

---

## Red Flags to Avoid

❌ **No BAA Available:** Never use a service without a signed BAA for PHI
❌ **Unclear Encryption Details:** If the vendor can't explain their security, move on
❌ **Shared Servers (Consumer Grade):** Avoid Google Drive, Dropbox (unless enterprise plan with BAA), or similar consumer services
❌ **No Audit Logging:** Cannot track who accessed files when
❌ **Data Stored Internationally:** Ensure servers are in your jurisdiction
❌ **Subcontractors Not Mentioned:** Ask if vendors use third parties and if they have BAAs
❌ **Per-File Fees:** Watch for hidden costs on large uploads or frequent transfers

2. **Schedule demos** with vendors (most offer free consultations)
3. **Request pricing quotes** customized to your practice size
4. **Ask for BAA templates** and review with legal counsel if desired
5. **Run a pilot** with a few test patients before full rollout
