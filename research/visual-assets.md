### Category 4: Aerospace/Performance (Altitude Chamber, G-Suit, Flight Suit, Pressure Suit)

**Research Notes:**
Specialized aerospace equipment imagery (altitude chambers, G-suits, pressure suits) is limited in free stock photo libraries. Most professional images are military/government documentation with restricted use.

**Available Options:**

1. **Unsplash Fitness/Performance:**
   - Athletic Performance: https://unsplash.com/s/photos/athlete
   - Training: https://unsplash.com/s/photos/training
   - Fitness: https://unsplash.com/s/photos/fitness
   - Sports Medicine: https://unsplash.com/s/photos/sports-medicine

2. **Military/Aerospace Theme:**
   - Military: https://unsplash.com/s/photos/military
   - Pilot: https://unsplash.com/s/photos/pilot
   - Air Force: https://unsplash.com/s/photos/air-force

**Recommended Substitution Strategy:**
For specialized aerospace medical equipment not readily available in free stock libraries:
- Commission custom photography (recommended)
- Use military aviator portraits from Unsplash: https://unsplash.com/s/photos/military-pilot
- Use aerospace/cockpit images from above categories
- Stock performance/athletic training imagery to represent human optimization

**Specific Images:**

1. Athlete/High-Performance Training
   - URL: https://unsplash.com/s/photos/athlete
   - Use: Human performance optimization messaging

2. Military Pilot Portrait
