          <p>FAA Special Issuance lets pilots fly again after a disqualifying cardiac event. It requires specific tests, precise timing, and documentation that speaks the FAA's language &mdash; not just a standard cardiology workup.</p>
          <p>Dr. Davenport is the FAA's Cardiovascular Specialty Consultant and author of every USAF cardiac waiver guide since 2009. He doesn't just understand the process &mdash; he helped design it.</p>

This shows whether any areas of your heart aren't getting enough blood. Must be done at least 6 months after your event.</li>
                    <li><strong>Exercise stress test</strong> (3rd Class) &mdash; A treadmill test called a "Bruce protocol" where you walk at increasing speed and incline for at least 9 minutes (6 minutes if you're 70 or older) while hooked up to an ECG. The goal: demonstrate your heart can handle real-world physical stress.</li>
                    <li><strong>Coronary angiogram</strong> (1st/2nd Class) &mdash; An imaging procedure where dye is injected through a catheter so doctors can see your coronary arteries in detail. Includes films and drawings of your artery anatomy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Blood work</strong> &mdash; Fasting cholesterol panel, blood sugar, and hemoglobin A1C (a measure of your average blood sugar over 3 months).</li>

                  <h4>Class Differences</h4>
                  <p>1st and 2nd Class require nuclear stress testing and a coronary angiogram &mdash; more extensive imaging than 3rd Class. Third Class applicants need only the treadmill stress test, not nuclear imaging or catheterization. However, if your treadmill test shows any abnormalities, additional imaging may be required.</p>

                  <p><strong>Good news about renewals:</strong> After your first approval, annual renewals are much simpler.

Your AME can renew your certificate same-day through the AASI program.</p>

                  <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                  <p>The FAA evaluates cardiomyopathy on a case-by-case basis. The key factor is how well your heart pumps, measured as your "ejection fraction" (EF) &mdash; the percentage of blood your heart pushes out with each beat. A normal EF is 55&ndash;70%. The FAA generally requires at least 40% for certification.</p>

                  <h4>Dilated Cardiomyopathy</h4>
                  <p>May be considered for <strong>all classes</strong> (1st, 2nd, and 3rd) if your ejection fraction is at least 40%, you have no defibrillator (ICD), and your condition is stable on medication.</p>

To qualify for 3rd Class, you must be over 40, have no history of fainting, no dangerous heart rhythm problems, and no immediate family members who died of sudden cardiac arrest. We'll review your specific situation and give you an honest assessment.</p>

                <p>It depends on your condition, but here are realistic ranges. A straightforward case with a complete initial submission typically takes <strong>2&ndash;3 months</strong> for FAA review after you've completed your waiting period and testing. If the FAA requests additional information (common for first-time applications), each request-response cycle adds <strong>2&ndash;4 weeks</strong>. Complex or unusual cases can take <strong>6&ndash;12 months</strong> for FAA review alone.</p>
                <p>The biggest factor in timeline is <strong>completeness of your initial submission</strong>. Incomplete packages trigger information requests that add months. That's exactly why working with someone who knows what the FAA expects &mdash; before you submit &mdash; makes such a difference.</p>
                <p><strong>Renewal is a different story.</strong> After your first approval, your AME can renew your certificate the same day you walk into their office, through a program called AASI (AME Assisted Special Issuance).</p>

                <p>BasicMed is an alternative to the standard FAA medical certificate for private flying (operations that would only need a 3rd Class medical). It uses a regular doctor's exam instead of an AME exam, with fewer testing requirements.</p>
                <p><strong>However, there's a catch for cardiac conditions.</strong> If you've had a heart attack, coronary disease requiring treatment, valve replacement, or heart transplant, you must first obtain at least one FAA Special Issuance before you can use BasicMed. You can't skip straight to BasicMed with these conditions.</p>
                <p>For some pilots, the strategy is: get your first Special Issuance, then transition to BasicMed for subsequent renewals to avoid the ongoing FAA paperwork. Whether this makes sense depends on what class of medical you need (BasicMed only covers 3rd Class operations) and your specific condition. We can help you think through the best long-term approach.</p>

                <p>AASI stands for <strong>AME Assisted Special Issuance</strong>. It's a program that lets your Aviation Medical Examiner (AME) renew your Special Issuance medical certificate <strong>right in their office, same day</strong> &mdash; without sending your paperwork to the FAA in Oklahoma City for review.</p>
                <p>Here's how it works: After the FAA approves your first Special Issuance, they give you an authorization letter that's good for up to 5 years. At each annual renewal, you bring your required follow-up testing and a status summary form to your AME. If everything looks good &mdash; all the checkboxes on the status summary are in the "yes" column &mdash; your AME issues your certificate on the spot.</p>
                <p>This is a huge improvement over the old system, where every renewal had to go through FAA review in Oklahoma City, taking weeks or months. AASI makes the annual renewal nearly as fast as a regular medical exam.</p>
